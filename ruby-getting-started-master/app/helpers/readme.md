# Application Helpers Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality through a web interface. The Application Helpers subproject provides a structured framework for implementing view-specific logic and presentation support across the application. While currently consisting of empty helper modules, this subproject follows Rails conventions for organizing reusable view functionality that can be expanded as the application grows.

This provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- View-specific logic encapsulation
- Cross-cutting presentation concerns
- Data formatting and HTML generation utilities
- Controller-specific view support

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Modular View Support**: Helper modules are organized by controller context (WelcomeHelper, WidgetsHelper) enabling targeted view assistance
2. **Application-Wide Utilities**: ApplicationHelper serves as the foundation for globally accessible view methods
3. **Convention-Based Structure**: Follows Rails naming conventions, making the codebase predictable and maintainable
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates view-specific logic from controllers and models, promoting cleaner architecture

## Overview
The Application Helpers architecture adheres to Rails conventions for organizing view-related functionality. Though currently implemented as placeholder modules, they provide a clear structure for future development of view helpers. The design supports the DRY principle by creating dedicated locations for reusable view logic. As the Ruby Demo application evolves, these helpers can be expanded to handle data formatting, complex HTML generation, and other presentation concerns without cluttering controllers or views with implementation details.

## Business Functions

### View Support
- `welcome_helper.rb` : Empty helper module for the Welcome controller in a Ruby on Rails application.
- `widgets_helper.rb` : Defines an empty helper module for widgets functionality in the Ruby on Rails application.
- `application_helper.rb` : Defines an empty ApplicationHelper module for shared view helper methods in the Ruby Demo application.

## Files
### application_helper.rb

ApplicationHelper module serves as a placeholder for application-wide view helper methods in the Ruby on Rails application. This empty module follows Rails convention where helper methods that need to be available across multiple views would be defined. While currently empty, developers would add methods here to extract common view logic, format data, or generate HTML that needs to be reused throughout the application's views.
### welcome_helper.rb

WelcomeHelper is an empty Rails helper module associated with the Welcome controller. In Rails, helper modules provide methods that can be used in views corresponding to a specific controller. This empty module serves as a placeholder where view helper methods for Welcome views would be defined if needed. The module follows Rails convention of naming helpers after controllers.
### widgets_helper.rb

WidgetsHelper is an empty Rails helper module that would typically contain view-related methods for the widgets feature. In Rails applications, helper modules provide methods that can be used in views to assist with formatting, calculations, or other view-specific logic. Currently, this module doesn't implement any functionality, suggesting that either the widget views don't require helper methods yet or they will be added in future development.
