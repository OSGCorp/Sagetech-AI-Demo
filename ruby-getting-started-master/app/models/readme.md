# Application Models Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality through a web interface. The Application Models subproject represents the data layer of the application, implementing the core domain entities through ActiveRecord models. This subproject provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- Object-Relational Mapping between database tables and Ruby objects
- Data validation and persistence mechanisms
- Query interface for retrieving widget data
- Domain model representation with associated business rules

## Identified Design Elements

1. **ActiveRecord Implementation**: Models inherit from ActiveRecord::Base to leverage Rails' ORM capabilities for automatic CRUD operations without explicit SQL
2. **Domain Entity Representation**: The Widget model encapsulates the core business entity of the application
3. **Database Abstraction**: Provides a Ruby-oriented interface to the underlying database schema
4. **Model-View Separation**: Maintains clean separation between data representation and presentation logic

## Overview
The architecture follows Rails' convention-over-configuration principle, with models serving as the foundation for the application's domain logic. The Widget model forms the core data structure that other components interact with. This design promotes maintainability by centralizing data access patterns and business rules within the model classes. The subproject is intentionally lightweight, relying on Rails' built-in ActiveRecord functionality to handle the complexities of database interactions, allowing developers to focus on implementing business-specific functionality rather than data access code.

## Business Functions

### Widget Management
- `widget.rb` : ActiveRecord model class for Widget entity in the Ruby Demo Rails application.

## Files
### widget.rb

Widget implements a basic ActiveRecord model class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. This model represents the widget entity in the Ruby Demo Rails application, enabling object-relational mapping between the widgets database table and Ruby objects. The class leverages Rails' ActiveRecord functionality to provide automatic CRUD operations, validations, associations, and query capabilities without explicit code. The file establishes the foundation for widget management in the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Though minimal, this class inherits all ActiveRecord functionality, providing database operations without explicit method definitions.
