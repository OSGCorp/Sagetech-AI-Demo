# Application Controllers Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality through a web interface. The Application Controllers sub-project implements the MVC controller layer that handles HTTP requests, processes business logic, and coordinates responses between models and views. This sub-project provides these core capabilities:

- RESTful resource management for widgets (CRUD operations)
- Multi-format response handling (HTML and JSON)
- Entry point routing and welcome functionality
- Parameter validation and security enforcement

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Base Controller Architecture**: ApplicationController serves as the foundation class, implementing CSRF protection and shared functionality for all derived controllers
   
2. **RESTful Resource Management**: WidgetsController implements the standard seven RESTful actions (index, show, new, edit, create, update, destroy) following Rails conventions

3. **Format Flexibility**: Controllers respond to both HTML requests (for browser interactions) and JSON requests (for API consumers)

4. **Strong Parameter Security**: Implementation of parameter whitelisting through private methods ensures data validation and prevents mass assignment vulnerabilities

## Overview
The architecture follows standard Rails MVC patterns with clear separation of concerns. The controllers are organized in a hierarchical structure with ApplicationController at the root. The WelcomeController provides an entry point to the application, while the WidgetsController handles the core business functionality around widget management. The design emphasizes RESTful principles, security best practices, and format flexibility to support both traditional web interfaces and API integrations.

## Business Functions

### Base Controllers
- `application_controller.rb` : Base controller class that provides CSRF protection for the Ruby Demo application.

### Widget Management
- `widgets_controller.rb` : Standard Rails controller managing CRUD operations for Widget resources with HTML and JSON responses.

### Application Entry Points
- `welcome_controller.rb` : Simple welcome controller that handles the application's landing page.

## Files
### application_controller.rb

ApplicationController implements the base controller class for the Ruby Demo Rails application. It inherits from ActionController::Base and enables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection by raising an exception when unverified requests are detected. This controller serves as the parent class for all other controllers in the application, providing common functionality and security measures.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Implements CSRF protection using Rails' built-in protect_from_forgery method with the exception strategy
### welcome_controller.rb

WelcomeController implements a minimal controller that inherits from ApplicationController. It defines only an empty index method that responds to GET requests at the /welcome route. This controller likely serves as the entry point for the Ruby Demo application, rendering a welcome page template without requiring any specific data preparation.
### widgets_controller.rb

WidgetsController implements a standard Ruby on Rails controller that handles all CRUD operations for Widget resources. It defines seven RESTful actions: index (lists all widgets), show (displays a specific widget), new (shows form for creating widgets), edit (shows form for editing), create (saves new widgets), update (modifies existing widgets), and destroy (removes widgets). The controller responds to both HTML and JSON formats, includes appropriate redirects and notices for successful operations, and implements private methods for setting the current widget and whitelisting permitted parameters (name, description, stock) through strong parameters.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Uses before_action callback to DRY up code by setting the widget instance variable for multiple actions
- `Line 29-39`: Implements format-specific responses using respond_to block pattern for content negotiation
- `Line 74`: Strong parameters implementation protects against mass assignment vulnerabilities
