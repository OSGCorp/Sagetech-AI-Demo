# Application Assets Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality with CRUD operations through a web interface. The Application Assets sub-project manages the frontend resources that define the application's visual presentation and client-side behavior. This sub-project implements the styling architecture and JavaScript functionality that enhances the user experience of the Ruby Demo application.

This provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- Centralized asset management through Rails asset pipeline
- Theme customization with SCSS variables and component styling
- Controller-specific stylesheets for modular design
- Client-side functionality through organized JavaScript dependencies

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Manifest-Based Asset Organization**: Both CSS and JavaScript use manifest files to coordinate inclusion of dependencies and maintain proper loading order
2. **SCSS Preprocessing**: Leverages Sass functionality for more maintainable stylesheets with variables, nesting, and mixins
3. **Controller-Specific Styling**: Separate stylesheets for widgets and welcome controllers promote separation of concerns
4. **Branded Theme Implementation**: Consistent visual identity through defined brand colors and custom component styling
5. **Scaffold Support**: Default styling for Rails-generated views ensures consistent appearance across the application

## Overview
The architecture follows Rails conventions for asset organization while enabling customization through SCSS. The theme implementation provides a cohesive visual identity with custom branding elements. The JavaScript manifest integrates essential libraries like jQuery and Turbolinks. This structure supports maintainability through modular design and separation of concerns, allowing developers to easily extend styling for specific controllers or components.

## Business Functions

### UI Styling
- `stylesheets/theme.css.scss` : Defines styling for the Ruby Demo application with custom branding and jumbotron component styling.
- `stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss` : Standard scaffold CSS styling for a Ruby on Rails application.

### Widget Management
- `stylesheets/widgets.css.scss` : Stylesheet for the Widgets controller in the Ruby on Rails application.

### Welcome Page
- `stylesheets/welcome.css.scss` : Stylesheet for the welcome controller in the Ruby Demo application.

### Core Assets
- `stylesheets/application.css` : Rails asset manifest file for CSS compilation and organization
- `javascripts/application.js` : JavaScript manifest file that specifies dependencies for the Rails application.

## Files
### javascripts/application.js

This manifest file configures JavaScript dependencies for the Ruby Demo Rails application. It uses Sprockets directives to include essential libraries like jQuery, jQuery UJS, and Turbolinks. The file serves as a central point for JavaScript inclusion, automatically loading all JavaScript files in specified directories through the require_tree directive. No custom JavaScript code is implemented directly in this file.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 15`: Uses Sprockets directives to include essential frontend libraries like jQuery and Turbolinks
- `Line 17`: The require_tree directive automatically includes all JavaScript files in the directory structure
### stylesheets/application.css

This manifest file controls how CSS assets are compiled in the Rails application. It serves as the entry point for all stylesheets, using Rails asset pipeline directives to include other CSS files. The file uses require_tree to include all stylesheets in the current directory and require_self to include styles defined directly in this file. This organization ensures application-wide styles take precedence over other defined styles.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 13`: The require_tree directive automatically includes all CSS/SCSS files in the current directory hierarchy
- `Line 14`: The require_self directive ensures styles defined directly in this file are included in the compiled output
### stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss

This SCSS file provides default styling for a Ruby on Rails scaffold-generated application. It defines basic visual styles for body text, links (including hover, visited states), error notifications, and form field styling. The stylesheet establishes a consistent visual foundation with specific typography settings, padding, and background colors for error messages. It includes styling for notice elements and field validation error indicators with red borders and text.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Uses SCSS syntax for CSS which allows for variables and nesting in stylesheets
- `Line 38`: Implements specific styling for field_with_errors class which Rails automatically adds to form fields with validation errors
### stylesheets/theme.css.scss

This SCSS file defines the theme styling for the Ruby Demo application. It establishes brand colors ($brand-primary and $brand-language) and styles the jumbotron component with custom background, text colors, button styling, and a language logo. The file creates a visually cohesive header section with responsive spacing, lighter-colored descriptive text, and a circular Ruby logo display with white border.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-2`: Defines brand color variables that can be reused throughout the application for consistent theming
- `Line 9-14`: Uses SCSS nesting and color functions (lighten) to create interactive button states with calculated color values
- `Line 22-35`: Creates a circular language logo with overflow handling, precise dimensions, and border styling
### stylesheets/welcome.css.scss

This SCSS file contains styles specifically for the welcome controller in the Ruby Demo Rails application. It's currently empty except for comments that explain how these styles will automatically be included in application.css and that developers can use Sass/SCSS syntax within this file. The comments also provide a reference link to the Sass documentation website.
### stylesheets/widgets.css.scss

This SCSS file is designated for styling related to the Widgets controller in the Ruby Demo application. It's automatically included in application.css and supports Sass functionality. The file is currently empty except for comments that provide information about its purpose and usage. The comments indicate that developers can use Sass/SCSS syntax for styling widget-related views and components.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-3`: Comments indicate the file follows Rails' asset pipeline convention where controller-specific styles are automatically included in the main application.css file
