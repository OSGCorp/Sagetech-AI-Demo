# Application Views Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality. The Application Views sub-project implements the presentation layer through embedded Ruby (ERB) templates that generate HTML for the web interface. This provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- Dynamic HTML generation for widget CRUD operations
- Consistent layout and styling across the application
- Response format flexibility supporting both HTML and JSON
- Modular view components through partial templates

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Views strictly handle presentation concerns, working with data provided by controllers to generate appropriate HTML output
2. **Partial Template Reuse**: Common UI elements like forms are extracted into partials (e.g., `_form.erb`) to promote DRY principles
3. **Bootstrap Integration**: Leverages Bootstrap framework for responsive design and consistent styling
4. **Navigation Structure**: Implements a hierarchical navigation system with breadcrumb-style links between related views

## Overview
The architecture is organized into logical view groups - a welcome page for application introduction, layout templates for consistent structure, and widget-specific views for CRUD operations. The widget views (`index`, `show`, `new`, `edit`) follow Rails conventions, with form handling extracted to a shared partial. The application layout provides the HTML skeleton, Bootstrap integration, and navigation components. This modular approach simplifies maintenance and extension of the UI while maintaining visual consistency throughout the application.

## Business Functions

### Widget Management
- `widgets/index.html.erb` : Widget listing view that displays all widgets in a table with actions for viewing, editing, and deleting.
- `widgets/edit.html.erb` : ERB template for editing widgets in the Ruby Demo application.
- `widgets/show.html.erb` : Widget detail view template that displays a single widget's properties and navigation links.
- `widgets/_form.html.erb` : A partial view template for widget form input in the Ruby Demo application.
- `widgets/new.html.erb` : View template for creating new widgets in the Ruby Demo application.

### Application Structure
- `layouts/application.html.erb` : Main application layout template defining the HTML structure and navigation for the Ruby Demo application.

### Landing Page
- `welcome/index.erb` : Welcome page template for a Ruby on Heroku demo application

## Files
### layouts/application.html.erb

This layout template establishes the HTML structure for all pages in the Ruby Demo application. It includes Bootstrap CSS/JS from CDN, application assets with Turbolinks tracking, and CSRF protection. The template features a responsive navigation bar with Heroku-related links including a home link, information about Heroku, and a dropdown menu containing various Heroku getting started guides. The layout uses Bootstrap's navbar component with glyphicon icons and yields to page-specific content.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5-8`: Includes both local application assets and CDN-hosted Bootstrap resources for styling and JavaScript functionality
- `Line 9`: Implements CSRF protection with Rails' built-in csrf_meta_tags helper
- `Line 45`: Uses Rails' yield helper to insert page-specific content from individual view templates
### welcome/index.erb

This view template renders the welcome page for a Ruby on Heroku demonstration application. It features a jumbotron header with the application logo, title, and description, followed by prominent buttons linking to Heroku documentation and GitHub source code. The page contains two informational sections: one explaining how the sample app works with Heroku's deployment process, and another providing helpful links to Heroku resources and documentation. The template uses Bootstrap for styling and includes explanatory text encouraging users to follow Heroku's Getting Started guide.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Uses Rails asset_path helper to dynamically generate the correct URL for the logo image
- `Line 8-9`: Implements call-to-action buttons with Bootstrap styling and glyphicon integration
### widgets/_form.html.erb

This partial template implements a form for creating and editing widgets in the Ruby on Rails application. It handles form submission, error display, and input fields for widget attributes. The form includes validation error messages at the top, followed by input fields for name (text field), description (text area), and stock (number field). The template uses Rails form helpers to generate appropriate HTML form elements and handles proper form submission through the form_for helper.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Uses form_for helper which automatically sets up the correct action URL and HTTP method based on whether @widget is a new or existing record
- `Line 2-13`: Implements error handling that displays validation errors with proper pluralization of 'error' based on count
- `Line 25`: Generic submit button adapts its label based on whether creating a new widget or updating an existing one
### widgets/edit.html.erb

This ERB template renders the edit page for widgets in the Ruby Demo application. It provides a simple interface with a heading, a form (included via partial), and navigation links to view the current widget or return to the widget index. The template is wrapped in a container div for styling purposes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5`: Uses Rails partial rendering with 'render' to include a reusable form component
### widgets/index.html.erb

This ERB template implements the index view for widgets, displaying them in a tabular format. It iterates through the @widgets collection to show each widget's name, description, and stock level. The view provides action links for showing, editing, and deleting individual widgets, with a confirmation dialog for deletion. It also includes a link to create new widgets. The template uses Bootstrap's container and table classes for styling.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 15`: Uses Ruby's ERB templating to iterate through the @widgets collection
- `Line 22`: Implements Rails' RESTful design with links to show, edit, and destroy actions
- `Line 22`: Uses data-confirm attribute for JavaScript confirmation dialog before deletion
### widgets/new.html.erb

This view template provides the interface for creating new widgets in the Ruby Demo application. It renders a form for widget creation using a partial template ('form') and includes a navigation link back to the widgets index page. The template is wrapped in a container div for styling purposes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5`: Renders a partial form template that likely contains the widget creation form fields and submission button.
- `Line 7`: Uses Rails' link_to helper to create a navigation link back to the widgets index page.
### widgets/show.html.erb

This ERB template renders the detail view for a single widget in the Ruby Demo application. It displays the widget's name, description, and stock level within a container div. The template includes a notice area for system messages and provides navigation links to edit the current widget or return to the widget listing page. The template accesses widget data through the @widget instance variable passed from the controller.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses Rails' notice flash message system to display system notifications to users
- `Line 17`: Rails link_to helper generates links with proper routes based on the widget resource
