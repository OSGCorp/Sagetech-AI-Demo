# Top Level Files Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that showcases widget management functionality with CRUD operations presented through a web interface. The Top Level Files subproject contains the foundational configuration files that define the application's dependencies, build processes, and documentation. These files establish the project's structure and provide essential information for developers working with the codebase.

This subproject implements dependency management through the Gemfile and version locking via Gemfile.lock, along with task automation through Rake. This provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- Consistent environment setup across development machines
- Automated build and deployment processes
- Clear documentation for onboarding and reference
- Dependency version control for stability

## Identified Design Elements

1. **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: The application is configured to use PostgreSQL as its primary database, ensuring robust data storage capabilities
2. **Heroku Deployment Support**: The inclusion of rails_12factor and configuration in the README demonstrates cloud deployment readiness
3. **Asset Pipeline Configuration**: The Gemfile includes necessary gems for processing SCSS, CoffeeScript, and JavaScript assets
4. **Development Workflow Optimization**: Spring and other development gems are included to improve developer experience and productivity

## Overview
The architecture follows Rails conventions with a clear separation of configuration files. The Gemfile serves as the central dependency manifest, while the Rakefile provides task automation capabilities. The README offers comprehensive setup instructions for both development and production environments. This foundation supports the application's widget management functionality while maintaining compatibility with modern deployment practices and development workflows.

## Gems Included

- **rails (4.2.0)**: The core web application framework providing MVC architecture and RESTful design principles
- **pg**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Active Record, enabling database connectivity
- **sass-rails**: Integrates Sass with the Rails asset pipeline for CSS preprocessing
- **uglifier**: JavaScript compressor for minifying JS assets in production
- **coffee-rails**: CoffeeScript adapter for the Rails asset pipeline
- **jquery-rails**: Provides jQuery and jQuery-ujs for Rails applications
- **turbolinks**: Makes navigating your web application faster by using AJAX
- **jbuilder**: DSL for declaring JSON structures for API responses
- **sdoc**: Documentation generator for Ruby code
- **rails_12factor**: Helps Rails applications run on Heroku by enabling static asset serving and logging
- **spring**: Rails application preloader that speeds up development by keeping application running in the background
- **puma**: A modern, concurrent web server for Ruby applications

## Business Functions

### Core Components
- `Rakefile` : Standard Rails Rakefile that loads application tasks for the Ruby Demo project.

### Application Dependencies
- `Gemfile` : Gemfile defines Ruby gem dependencies for a Rails 4.2.0 application using PostgreSQL database.
- `Gemfile.lock` : Dependency lock file specifying exact versions of Ruby gems used in the Ruby Demo application.

### Documentation
- `README.md` : README for a barebones Ruby on Rails application that can be deployed to Heroku or used with GitLab CI/CD.

## Files
### Gemfile

This Gemfile specifies the Ruby gems required for a Rails 4.2.0 application. It includes essential gems like PostgreSQL adapter, asset processing tools (SCSS, CoffeeScript, Uglifier), jQuery, Turbolinks, and Jbuilder. The file organizes gems by environment, with rails_12factor for production and development tools like Spring. It also includes the Puma web server and has several commented-out gems that could be uncommented if needed, such as bcrypt for authentication and Capistrano for deployment.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 6`: Specifies PostgreSQL as the database adapter, indicating this is a production-ready application rather than using SQLite
- `Line 7`: Includes rails_12factor gem specifically for production environment, which is required for proper deployment to Heroku
- `Line 33`: Uses Puma as the web server, which is a modern concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby applications
### Gemfile.lock

Gemfile.lock is an automatically generated file that locks all gem dependencies to specific versions, ensuring consistent installations across environments. It specifies Rails 4.2.0 as the core framework along with its components (actionmailer, actionpack, etc.). The file lists all direct dependencies from the Gemfile and their transitive dependencies with exact versions. Key gems include pg for PostgreSQL database connectivity, puma as the web server, and rails_12factor for Heroku deployment support. The file ensures that anyone installing the application gets identical gem versions.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Uses Rails 4.2.0, which is now outdated and may have security vulnerabilities
- `Line 73`: Uses PostgreSQL adapter indicating a production-grade database choice
- `Line 74`: Puma web server suggests deployment readiness for concurrent requests
- `Line 92`: rails_12factor gem indicates Heroku deployment configuration
### README.md

This README provides instructions for setting up, running, and deploying a basic Ruby on Rails application. It includes steps for local development setup, deployment to Heroku, and links to supporting documentation. The file outlines requirements like Ruby and Heroku Toolbelt, commands for cloning the repository, installing dependencies, creating and migrating databases, and starting the application locally on port 5000. It also provides commands for Heroku deployment and links to additional resources.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 9`: References integration with GitLab CI/CD, indicating the project supports automated testing and deployment pipelines
- `Line 17`: Uses foreman to manage the application processes, which is important for maintaining parity between development and production environments
- `Line 24`: Demonstrates Heroku's git-based deployment workflow which simplifies the deployment process
### Rakefile

This Rakefile serves as the entry point for all Rake tasks in the Ruby Demo Rails application. It loads the Rails application environment and makes all defined tasks available to the Rake command-line tool. The file follows Rails convention by requiring the application configuration and loading all tasks. Custom tasks can be added in the lib/tasks directory with .rake extensions, which will be automatically available.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Loads the Rails application environment using File.expand_path to ensure proper path resolution regardless of working directory
