# Database / Persistence Of Ruby Demo

The Ruby Demo is a Ruby on Rails application that implements widget management functionality through a PostgreSQL database backend. The program performs CRUD operations on widget data and exposes this functionality through a web interface. This sub-project implements the database schema definition and data persistence layer along with migration capabilities for schema evolution. This provides these capabilities to the Ruby Demo program:

- PostgreSQL database integration for reliable relational data storage
- Schema definition for widget entities with appropriate data types
- Database migration framework for controlled schema evolution
- Seed data functionality for initial application setup

## Identified Design Elements

1. Schema Management: Auto-generated schema.rb provides the authoritative source for database structure, defining the widgets table with appropriate columns
2. Migration Framework: Structured migration files (like 20140707111715_create_widgets.rb) enable versioned, repeatable database schema changes
3. Seed Data Support: The seeds.rb file provides a mechanism for populating the database with initial or test data
4. PostgreSQL Extensions: The schema enables PostgreSQL-specific extensions to leverage advanced database features

## Overview
The architecture follows Rails conventions for database persistence, with clear separation between schema definition, data seeding, and migration capabilities. The widgets table forms the core data structure with fields for name (string), description (text), and stock (integer), plus automatic timestamp tracking. The migration system ensures database schema can evolve alongside application code, while the seeds.rb mechanism supports consistent initialization of application data. This foundation supports the application's CRUD operations and web interface for widget management.

## Business Functions

### Database Schema
- `schema.rb` : Auto-generated database schema defining the structure of the Ruby Demo application's PostgreSQL database.

### Data Seeding
- `seeds.rb` : Database seed file for initializing the application with default data.

### Database Migrations
- `migrate/20140707111715_create_widgets.rb` : Database migration file that creates the widgets table with name, description, and stock fields.

## Files
### migrate/20140707111715_create_widgets.rb

CreateWidgets implements a database migration that defines the structure for the widgets table in the application. It creates a table with columns for name (string), description (text), and stock (integer), along with automatically managed timestamp fields. This migration establishes the foundation for storing widget data that will be managed through the application's CRUD operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Uses ActiveRecord::Migration to handle database schema changes in a version-controlled way
### schema.rb

This schema.rb file is an auto-generated representation of the database structure for the Ruby Demo application. It defines the database schema at version 20140707111715, enables the PostgreSQL extension, and creates a 'widgets' table with columns for name (string), description (text), stock (integer), and timestamps for creation and updates. The file serves as the authoritative source for the database schema and is meant to be used with db:schema:load rather than running migrations from scratch.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 15`: Schema version tracking (20140707111715) enables Rails to know which migrations have been applied
- `Line 19`: PostgreSQL extension enablement shows this application specifically uses PostgreSQL database features
- `Line 21`: The widgets table definition represents the core data model of this demo application
### seeds.rb

This seed file is designed to populate the Ruby Demo database with initial records. It provides a template for creating default data that can be loaded using rake db:seed or during database setup. The file includes commented examples showing how to create records for cities and mayors, demonstrating the syntax for single and batch record creation with associations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 6-7`: Shows how to create multiple records in a single transaction using an array of hashes
