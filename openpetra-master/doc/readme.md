# Documentation Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is an open-source software system designed to help non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. The Documentation subproject serves as a critical knowledge repository for developers working with the Petra codebase, with particular focus on the Shepherd Framework. This subproject implements comprehensive technical documentation along with visual architecture representations. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Framework documentation for developer onboarding
- Visual representation of system architecture through UML diagrams
- Standardized interface specifications for consistent UI development
- Configuration templates for implementing installer-like dialog interfaces

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Shepherd Framework Documentation**: Provides detailed specifications for creating guided, multi-step interfaces with standardized navigation controls
2. **Visual Architecture Representation**: UML diagrams showing class relationships and system structure in both editable (.ncp) and viewable (PNG) formats
3. **Standardized UI Component Specifications**: Defines consistent layout patterns including Top Panel, Content Panel, and Buttons Panel
4. **YAML Configuration Structure**: Offers declarative approach to defining Shepherd interfaces without extensive coding

## Overview
The Documentation subproject focuses on the Shepherd Framework, which enables developers to create consistent installer-like dialog interfaces throughout the application. The architecture emphasizes visual inheritance through .NET WinForms to maintain interface consistency. The documentation provides both technical specifications and visual representations to guide implementation, with clear separation between navigation elements and content areas. This standardization helps ensure a cohesive user experience while simplifying the development of complex multi-step interfaces within the Petra application.

## Business Functions

### Documentation
- `Readme Shepherd Framework.txt` : Documentation for the Shepherd Framework, including HTML documentation and UML diagrams showing class relationships.
- `Shepherd Framework.html` : Documentation page describing the OpenPetra Shepherd Framework for creating guided, multi-step dialog interfaces.

## Files
### Readme Shepherd Framework.txt

This documentation folder contains resources explaining the Shepherd Framework used in OpenPetra. It includes basic HTML documentation created by Taylor students in May 2011, along with UML diagrams from January 2013 created using NClass. The UML diagrams are available in both the original NClass format (.ncp) and as an exported PNG image, providing visual representation of all classes and their relationships within the Shepherd Framework.
### Shepherd Framework.html

This HTML document provides documentation for the OpenPetra Shepherd Framework, which helps create installer-like dialog interfaces with Next-Back-Finish buttons. The framework uses .NET WinForms visual inheritance to create standardized multi-step interfaces called 'Shepherds' that guide users through data entry processes. The document outlines the desired layout features including a Top Panel for headings, Content Panel for data entry, Buttons Panel for navigation controls, and a proposed Navigation Panel using collapsible panels and task lists. It also includes a YAML structure specification for configuring Shepherd interfaces and references related components like Collapsible Panels and Task Lists.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Describes the use of .NET WinForms Visual Inheritance to create standardized UI components with inherited layout and functionality
- `Line 105`: Shows integration with other UI components (Collapsible Panel and Task List) to create a navigation system
- `Line 121`: Outlines a YAML-based configuration structure for defining Shepherd interfaces
