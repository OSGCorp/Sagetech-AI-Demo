# Setup Subproject Of Petra

The Setup subproject is a critical component of OpenPetra that handles system configuration, initialization, and maintenance operations. This module provides the foundation for the application's operational parameters and ensures proper system bootstrapping. The Setup subproject implements configuration management and system initialization processes along with administrative tools for maintaining the OpenPetra environment. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- System configuration and parameter management
- Database initialization and schema management
- User account and permission setup
- Site-specific customization options
- System maintenance utilities
  - Backup and restore functionality
  - Database verification tools
  - Configuration validation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Configuration Repository**: Centralized storage and retrieval of system-wide settings with support for hierarchical configuration structures
2. **Database Initialization Framework**: Automated schema creation and migration tools to maintain database integrity across versions
3. **User Management System**: Comprehensive user account creation, authentication, and authorization management
4. **Modular Configuration Interface**: Extensible architecture allowing modules to register their configuration requirements
5. **Configuration Validation**: Robust validation mechanisms to ensure system integrity and prevent misconfiguration

## Overview
The Setup subproject architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation between configuration storage, business logic, and user interfaces. It employs a plugin-based extension model allowing other modules to register configuration requirements while maintaining centralized management. The system supports both interactive setup through web interfaces and automated deployment through configuration files and command-line tools. Setup operations are transactional where possible to ensure system integrity, with comprehensive logging and error recovery mechanisms to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Sub-Projects

### setup/linuxserver

This subproject implements server instance management and web server configuration, enabling OpenPetra to function as a robust, multi-tenant web application. The components work together to create a complete server environment that supports the core OpenPetra functionality for non-profit organizations.

Key capabilities provided to the OpenPetra program:

- Multi-tenant deployment architecture supporting isolated instances for different customers
- Comprehensive server lifecycle management (start, stop, backup, restore)
- Database operations for both MySQL and PostgreSQL backends
- Web server configuration with proper routing and API endpoints

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Instance Isolation**: Each OpenPetra instance has separate configurations, databases, and runtime environments to ensure security and stability
2. **Unified Management Interface**: The `openpetra-server.sh` script provides a consistent interface for all server administration tasks
3. **Flexible Database Support**: The architecture accommodates multiple database backends with standardized operations
4. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**: Nginx handles request routing, static content serving, and API proxying to internal services

#### Overview
The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation between web-facing components and backend services. The server management script provides comprehensive administration capabilities while the Nginx configuration handles HTTP request routing and security. The system supports both traditional web interfaces and API access, with proper URL rewriting and FastCGI proxying. The multi-tenant design allows for efficient resource utilization while maintaining isolation between customer instances, making it suitable for both single-organization deployments and service provider scenarios.

### setup/releasenotes

The program provides comprehensive management capabilities and supports international operations with multi-currency features. This sub-project implements the release notes documentation system along with version history tracking. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Multilingual documentation of software changes
- Chronological tracking of feature additions and bug fixes
- Module-specific change documentation (Contacts, Donations, Accounting, etc.)
- Links to GitHub milestones for detailed technical information

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Multilingual Support: The documentation system maintains separate HTML files for different languages (e.g., English and German versions)
2. Chronological Organization: Release notes are structured with newest versions at the top for easy access to recent changes
3. Modular Documentation: Changes are categorized by functional modules (Contacts, Donations, Accounting, Sponsorships, System)
4. External Reference Integration: Links to GitHub milestones provide deeper technical context for developers

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clear communication of software changes to both technical and non-technical users. The documentation is structured to highlight significant features, improvements, and bug fixes across different modules of the OpenPetra system. The release notes serve as both a historical record of development and a reference for users to understand changes between versions. The multilingual support ensures accessibility to international users, aligning with OpenPetra's mission to serve non-profit organizations globally.
