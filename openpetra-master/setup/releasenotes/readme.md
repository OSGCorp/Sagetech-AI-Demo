# Setup Release Notes Subproject Of Petra

The Petra is an open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks and reduce operational costs. The program provides comprehensive management capabilities and supports international operations with multi-currency features. This sub-project implements the release notes documentation system along with version history tracking. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Multilingual documentation of software changes
- Chronological tracking of feature additions and bug fixes
- Module-specific change documentation (Contacts, Donations, Accounting, etc.)
- Links to GitHub milestones for detailed technical information

## Identified Design Elements

1. Multilingual Support: The documentation system maintains separate HTML files for different languages (e.g., English and German versions)
2. Chronological Organization: Release notes are structured with newest versions at the top for easy access to recent changes
3. Modular Documentation: Changes are categorized by functional modules (Contacts, Donations, Accounting, Sponsorships, System)
4. External Reference Integration: Links to GitHub milestones provide deeper technical context for developers

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clear communication of software changes to both technical and non-technical users. The documentation is structured to highlight significant features, improvements, and bug fixes across different modules of the OpenPetra system. The release notes serve as both a historical record of development and a reference for users to understand changes between versions. The multilingual support ensures accessibility to international users, aligning with OpenPetra's mission to serve non-profit organizations globally.
