## XML Accounts Receivable Section Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a cross-platform application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles contact management, accounting workflows, and financial reporting with internationalization support. This sub-project implements XML-based reporting templates for accounts receivable operations, specifically focusing on conference payment tracking and reconciliation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Participant payment status tracking for conference management
- Financial reconciliation between registrations and received payments
- Customizable reporting with multiple parameter inputs
- Data extraction for financial follow-up activities

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Templates: The system uses structured XML definitions to create consistent, reusable report templates that separate presentation from data logic
2. Parameterized Queries: Reports accept multiple input parameters (ledger number, conference key, date ranges, motivation codes) to filter and customize output
3. Complex Data Relationships: The architecture handles relationship mapping between participant registrations and corresponding payment records
4. Formatted Output Generation: Templates define precise presentation formatting for tabular data with consistent column structures

## Overview
The architecture follows a template-based approach for report generation, allowing for consistent styling and presentation while maintaining separation between data retrieval logic and presentation. The XML templates serve as declarative definitions that can be modified independently of application code. This design supports financial reconciliation workflows by identifying discrepancies between expected and actual payments, enabling conference organizers to follow up with participants who have outstanding balances.

## Business Functions

### Conference Management
- `ConferencePayments.xml` : XML report definition for tracking unpaid conference registrations by comparing participant records with gift payment data.

## Files
### ConferencePayments.xml

This XML report definition creates a report for conference organizers to identify registered participants who haven't made payments. It queries the database to find participants registered for a specific conference who don't have corresponding gift records with matching motivation codes. The report accepts parameters for ledger number, conference key, payment start date, and motivation codes. Key calculations include GetParticipantsWithoutPayment which returns partner keys, names, and registration dates for participants without matching payments. The report displays this information in a formatted table with columns for partner key, participant name, and registration date.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 33`: Uses SQL subquery with NOT EXISTS to efficiently filter participants without matching payment records
- `Line 54`: Implements CSV function to dynamically build SQL condition from comma-separated motivation parameters
- `Line 21`: Report header comments indicate this is a temporary solution until a proper Accounts Receivable system is implemented
