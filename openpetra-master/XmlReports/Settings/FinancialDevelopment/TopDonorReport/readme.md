# XML Top Donor Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Top Donor Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's financial development module that enables organizations to analyze and identify their most significant contributors. This sub-project implements a configurable reporting framework that processes donor data and generates structured reports based on customizable thresholds and parameters. The implementation provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable donor filtering based on percentage thresholds
- Flexible currency formatting for international organizations
- Donor segmentation by type and motivation groups
- Structured output with customizable column configurations

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The system uses XML configuration files to define report parameters, allowing for easy customization without code changes
2. **Hierarchical Parameter Structure**: System parameters, data sources, and display options are organized in a logical hierarchy within the configuration
3. **Flexible Data Filtering**: The architecture supports multiple filtering criteria including percentage thresholds and donor classifications
4. **Columnar Output Formatting**: Precise control over output formatting with defined column widths and data presentation rules

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined through XML structures rather than hard-coded logic. This design promotes maintainability by centralizing report definitions and separating presentation concerns from data processing. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial development module while maintaining its own configuration scope, making it adaptable to different organizational needs while preserving consistency with the overall application framework.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Top Donor Report in OpenPetra's financial development module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Top Donor Report in OpenPetra's financial development module. It specifies report settings including system parameters, XML data sources, display options, and column configurations. The file sets default values for filtering criteria such as percentage thresholds, currency format, donor types, and motivation groups. It also defines the report's column structure with specifications for Donor Key, Partner Class, Donor Name, Total Gifts, percentage calculations, and address information, along with their respective column widths.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Defines maximum number of columns that can be displayed in the report
- `Line 5-6`: Sets default percentage threshold for donor inclusion and controls whether detailed motivation information is shown
- `Line 15-16`: Controls donor selection type ('top') which affects filtering logic in the report generation
- `Line 18-29`: Defines column structure with precise width specifications using both integer and decimal formats
