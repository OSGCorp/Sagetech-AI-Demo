# XML Donors Per Recipient Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Donors Per Recipient Report is a specialized configuration component within OpenPetra's financial development reporting system. This subproject implements a structured XML-based definition for generating detailed donor-to-recipient relationship reports, enabling non-profit organizations to track and analyze their donation flows effectively. The configuration architecture provides a declarative approach to report generation that separates presentation concerns from data extraction logic.

## Key Technical Features

- Configurable column definitions with 17 pre-defined display fields
- Parameterized calculation types for financial aggregation
- Flexible sorting mechanisms with multi-level donor key prioritization
- Currency formatting and internationalization support
- Year-to-date calculation parameters for temporal analysis
- Dimensional column width specifications for consistent report rendering

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure, separating report design from application logic
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Structures donor information in a parent-child relationship model
3. **Financial Calculation Framework**: Supports various calculation types for monetary aggregation and analysis
4. **Presentation Layer Integration**: Defines visual aspects like column widths and formatting for consistent output
5. **Extensible Column System**: Allows for adding or modifying displayed information fields without code changes

## Architecture
The report configuration integrates with OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer, providing a bridge between the data access components and the presentation layer. The standard.xml file serves as the central definition point for report behavior, with references to supporting configuration files for extended functionality.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Financial Development Donors Per Recipient report defining display columns and parameters.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the configuration settings for the Financial Development Donors Per Recipient report in OpenPetra. It specifies 17 display columns showing donor information including donor key, name, address details, gift information, and subscription data. The file sets column widths, calculation parameters, and sorting preferences. Each column has parameters for calculation type, width, and year-to-date settings. The configuration also includes system settings, references to related XML files, sorting order by donor key, first name and surname, and currency formatting options.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5`: References external XML files that contain the actual report implementation logic
- `Line 6`: Identifies the current report as 'FDDonorsPerRecipient' for system reference
- `Line 7`: Limits display to 17 columns maximum, controlling UI layout
- `Line 76-78`: Defines multi-level sorting order for report data presentation
