# XML Method Of Giving Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Method Of Giving Report is a specialized financial reporting component within OpenPetra that focuses on analyzing and presenting donation data categorized by giving methods. This subproject implements configuration-driven financial report generation through XML-based parameter definitions, providing these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured financial data presentation based on giving methods
- Configurable report formatting and currency handling
- Flexible period comparison options for trend analysis
- Hierarchical account representation with adjustable depth levels

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The subproject uses XML configuration files to define report parameters, enabling flexible report customization without code changes
2. **Financial Parameter Management**: Implements comprehensive handling of currency settings, account hierarchies, and period options
3. **Standardized Report Identification**: Maintains consistent report identification within the broader OpenPetra reporting framework
4. **Display Formatting Controls**: Provides detailed configuration for how financial data is visually presented and formatted

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where the `standard.xml` file serves as the central definition point for report behavior. This design separates report logic from presentation concerns, allowing financial administrators to customize reports without developer intervention. The XML structure defines both technical parameters (data sources, system settings) and business parameters (account hierarchies, currency handling, period comparisons), creating a flexible reporting framework specifically tailored for analyzing donation methods within nonprofit financial management.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Method of Giving financial development report with standard parameters.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines standard parameters for the Method of Giving financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML source files, report identification, and various financial parameters including account hierarchy, currency settings, period options, and display formatting. The file establishes default values for report generation, including currency format, reporting depth, and period comparison options. These parameters control how financial development data related to giving methods is processed and presented in the report output.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report definition and common elements
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter set to 0 allows dynamic column count based on data
- `Line 8`: Uses STANDARD account hierarchy which affects how financial data is organized and grouped
- `Line 13`: Date-based parameters control temporal aspects of financial reporting
