## XML Income Local Split Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Income Local Split Report is a specialized financial reporting component within OpenPetra's accounting framework. This subproject implements standardized financial report generation with a focus on income splitting for local accounting purposes. The configuration-driven architecture allows for flexible report formatting while maintaining consistent financial calculations across the organization's accounting system.

The subproject operates through XML-based configuration files that define report parameters, calculation methods, and display formats. It integrates with OpenPetra's FinancialDevelopment module to generate standardized financial reports that can be used by non-profit organizations for tracking income distribution and financial analysis.

Key capabilities provided to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial report generation with standardized layouts
- Multiple calculation perspectives (absolute amounts and percentages)
- Year-to-date financial tracking and comparison
- Hierarchical account structure representation
- Currency formatting appropriate to the organization's locale

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, calculations, and formatting without requiring code changes
2. **Multi-Column Financial Analysis**: Supports comparative financial analysis through multiple calculation methods in parallel columns
3. **Hierarchical Account Representation**: Maintains organizational structure of accounts while presenting financial data
4. **Temporal Analysis Support**: Provides both current-period and year-to-date calculations for comprehensive financial review
5. **Integration with FinancialDevelopment Module**: Leverages core financial data processing capabilities while adding specialized reporting features

The architecture emphasizes configurability and standardization, allowing organizations to maintain consistent financial reporting while adapting to specific accounting needs. The XML configuration approach enables report modifications without requiring code changes, supporting the overall OpenPetra goal of reducing administrative overhead for non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for Income Local Split financial report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Income Local Split financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML source files, report formatting options, and column configurations. The file sets up four display columns with different calculations: Amount, Percentage of Grand Income, Amount Year-to-Date, and Percentage Year-to-Date. Each column has defined width, position, and calculation parameters. Additional parameters control currency format, account hierarchy, ordering, and display depth. This configuration works with the FinancialDevelopment module to generate standardized financial reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report structure and common elements
- `Line 15`: Currency formatting parameter set to 'CurrencyWithoutDecimals' affecting how all monetary values display
- `Line 17-31`: Column configuration uses a combination of calculation types and YTD flags to create comparative financial views
