# XML Gifts Over Amount Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source administration system that helps non-profit organizations manage financial data and reduce operational overhead. This sub-project implements specialized financial reporting capabilities focused on identifying and analyzing gifts that exceed specified monetary thresholds. The XML Gifts Over Amount Report provides configurable financial intelligence to organizations tracking significant donations.

This subproject delivers these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable gift threshold reporting with customizable minimum amount settings
- Currency-aware financial data presentation with formatting controls
- Flexible donor filtering options for targeted analysis
- Customizable column display with width and calculation specifications
- Year-to-date calculation capabilities for longitudinal analysis

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration Architecture**: Uses declarative XML configuration to define report parameters, enabling non-programmatic customization of report behavior
2. **Financial Data Filtering System**: Implements threshold-based filtering to identify significant gifts based on configurable amount parameters
3. **Multi-Currency Support**: Provides currency formatting and handling capabilities for international organizations
4. **Columnar Data Presentation**: Configures four primary data columns (Gift Date, Motivation Detail, Gift Recipient, Total Gifts) with customizable widths and calculations
5. **Donor Segmentation**: Includes filtering mechanisms to analyze gifts from specific donor categories or segments

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined through XML specifications rather than hard-coded logic. This design promotes flexibility and maintainability by allowing report modifications without code changes. The system integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial tracking capabilities while providing specialized analysis for significant gifts, supporting the financial development and donor relationship management needs of non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Gifts Over Amount financial report defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Gifts Over Amount' financial development report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML source files, and report configuration options including minimum gift amount, currency settings, sorting preferences, and donor filtering options. The file configures four display columns with their respective widths and calculations: Gift Date, Motivation Detail, Gift Recipient, and Total Gifts. Additional parameters control currency formatting, year-to-date calculations, and which column contains the gift amount. These settings determine how financial gift data exceeding specified thresholds will be presented in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Links multiple XML files (giftsoveramount.xml and common.xml) to compose the complete report definition
- `Line 9-11`: Configurable donor filtering options for anonymous donors and no-solicitation flags
- `Line 12-13`: Hierarchical motivation filtering with both group and detail level parameters
- `Line 14-27`: Column-specific parameter structure with calculation type, width and YTD settings for each display column
