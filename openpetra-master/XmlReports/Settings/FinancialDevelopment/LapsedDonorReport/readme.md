# XML Lapsed Donor Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The XML Lapsed Donor Report subproject implements specialized donor tracking functionality within the Financial Development module, enabling organizations to identify and analyze donors who have ceased their regular contributions. This subproject is primarily configuration-driven through XML definitions that specify report parameters, data extraction rules, and presentation formats.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable lapsed donor identification based on customizable time periods
- Multi-year gift comparison analysis with flexible tolerance settings
- Parameterized filtering by donation amount, currency, and motivation groups
- Customizable display columns with year-to-date calculations and formatting rules

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Parameter-Driven Configuration**: The report's behavior is controlled through XML configuration, allowing for customization without code changes
2. **Multi-Currency Support**: Built-in handling for international currency formatting and conversion
3. **Flexible Data Extraction**: Configurable partner selection criteria and data filtering options
4. **Columnar Display Framework**: Standardized column definitions with width specifications, calculations, and formatting rules
5. **Year-to-Year Comparison Logic**: Specialized algorithms for comparing donor patterns across multiple time periods

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined through structured XML rather than procedural code. This design enables non-technical users to modify report parameters while maintaining consistent data extraction and presentation logic. The system integrates with OpenPetra's partner management and financial subsystems to provide comprehensive donor tracking capabilities while supporting the international nature of non-profit operations.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Lapsed Donor Report in OpenPetra's Financial Development module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Lapsed Donor Report in OpenPetra's Financial Development module. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, report identification, and display configuration. The file configures report parameters including days tolerance, frequency, minimum amount, currency settings, motivation filters, and sorting preferences. It also defines six display columns with their calculations, widths, and year-to-date settings - showing donor information and gift history across multiple years. Additional parameters control currency formatting, partner selection, data extraction options, and recipient identification.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the report definition logic
- `Line 14`: Configures sorting by donor name which affects the report's organization
- `Line 15-32`: Defines a 6-column structure showing historical gift data across multiple years
- `Line 33`: Specifies currency formatting style for monetary values
