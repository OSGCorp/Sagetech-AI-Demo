# XML Donor Short Report Subproject Of Petra

The XML Donor Short Report is a configuration-driven financial reporting component within the OpenPetra ecosystem. This subproject implements standardized donor financial reporting capabilities through XML-based configuration templates, enabling consistent financial data presentation across the application. The configuration architecture allows for flexible column definitions, data filtering, and formatting rules without requiring code changes.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Parameterized financial report generation for donor contributions
- Configurable column definitions with specialized calculation types
- Partner data filtering and classification
- Standardized currency formatting and presentation
- Year-to-date financial aggregation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The standard.xml file serves as the template defining report structure, enabling separation of presentation logic from application code
2. **Flexible Column Definitions**: Supports up to 9 configurable columns with different calculation types (DonorKey, Partner Class, Partner Name, Address details, Total Given)
3. **Partner Source Filtering**: Configuration parameters control which partner records appear in reports
4. **Sorting and Aggregation**: Built-in support for sorting by donor name and calculating year-to-date totals

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, allowing financial report customization without programming. The XML template structure provides a declarative approach to defining report parameters, calculations, and presentation rules. This design supports maintainability by centralizing report definitions in standardized configuration files, while the calculation types provide extensibility for different financial reporting needs across the broader OpenPetra application.

## Business Functions

### Configuration Files
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the DonorReportShort XML report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the DonorReportShort financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML source files, and report display properties including maximum column count (9) and sorting by donor name. The file configures each column with calculation types (DonorKey, Partner Class, Partner Name, Address details, Total Given), column widths, and year-to-date settings. Additional parameters control currency format and partner source filtering, providing a complete template for generating standardized donor reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Links multiple XML files (donorreportshort.xml and common.xml) to create the complete report definition
- `Line 7`: Defines partner source as 'AllPartner' which affects data selection scope for the report
- `Line 8-9`: Configures base currency and sorting by donor name, critical for financial reporting consistency
