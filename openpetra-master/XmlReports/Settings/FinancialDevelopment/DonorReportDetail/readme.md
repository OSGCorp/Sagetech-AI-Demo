# XML Donor Detail Report Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a financial management system designed for non-profit organizations, with this subproject implementing detailed donor reporting capabilities through XML configuration. The XML Donor Detail Report subproject provides a structured framework for generating comprehensive donor activity reports within the financial development module. This configuration-driven approach enables flexible reporting with minimal code changes, allowing organizations to analyze donation patterns and financial contributions effectively.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration for report definition and customization
- Structured column layout with configurable widths and calculations
- Financial data aggregation with year-to-date calculation support
- Currency formatting and internationalization capabilities
- Motivation-based filtering for targeted donor analysis
- Customizable sorting options (default: by Donor Name)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure, separating presentation from business logic
2. **Modular Parameter System**: Enables easy modification of report behavior through configuration rather than code changes
3. **Financial Calculation Framework**: Supports complex financial aggregations and year-to-date calculations
4. **Flexible Display Options**: Configurable column widths, sorting preferences, and detail level settings

## Architecture Overview

The subproject follows a configuration-as-code approach, with the `standard.xml` file serving as the central definition point for report behavior. It integrates with Petra's broader financial development module while maintaining separation of concerns through the Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer. The design emphasizes maintainability and extensibility, allowing for easy adaptation to changing reporting requirements without significant code modifications.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for donor report detail settings in OpenPetra's financial development module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the DonorReportDetail report in OpenPetra's financial development module. It specifies system settings, XML file dependencies, report identification, and display configurations. The file sets up four display columns with specific calculations (Gift Date, Gift Recipient Key, Gift Details, and Gift Amount) along with their respective column widths and year-to-date settings. Additional parameters control sorting options (by Donor Name), currency format, motivation filtering, and display preferences for detailed motivation information.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the core report structure
- `Line 6`: Limits display to maximum 4 columns for report layout
- `Line 11-12`: Parameters for filtering by motivation group/detail affect report content generation
- `Line 14-26`: Column configuration uses indexed parameters to define display structure
