# XML Total Gifts Per Donor Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Total Gifts Per Donor Report is a specialized financial reporting component within OpenPetra that generates comprehensive donor contribution summaries. This sub-project implements a structured XML-based configuration approach for financial data extraction and presentation, focusing on donor gift analysis. The configuration architecture uses declarative XML definitions to control report generation without requiring code changes for report modifications.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial reporting with nine standardized display columns
- Donor information consolidation (keys, names, address details) with gift totals
- Customizable sorting, currency formatting, and filtering options
- Parameter-driven period calculations and account hierarchy integration

## Identified Design Elements

1. Declarative Report Configuration: Uses XML to define report structure, allowing non-programmers to modify report layouts and behaviors
2. Parameter-Driven Processing: Implements flexible filtering through system parameters for period calculations and country filtering
3. Column Definition Framework: Provides standardized width settings and calculation types for consistent report generation
4. Financial Data Integration: Connects to OpenPetra's core financial data structures for accurate gift totals and donor information

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over coding through XML-based definitions, maintains consistent financial data presentation, and provides comprehensive donor contribution analysis. The report template is designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation between report definition and data processing logic. This approach allows financial administrators to generate detailed donor contribution reports while supporting OpenPetra's mission of helping non-profit organizations efficiently manage their financial administration.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Total Gifts Per Donor financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Total Gifts Per Donor financial report in OpenPetra. It configures report settings including system parameters, XML source files, column definitions, and display options. The file specifies nine display columns showing donor information (key, name, address details) and gift totals. It also defines sorting preferences, currency formatting, and filtering options. Parameters include settings for period calculations, account hierarchy, and country filtering. Each column has associated width settings and calculation types, creating a comprehensive donor gift analysis report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report definition logic
- `Line 13-15`: Parameters for time period filtering with options for quarter, period, and year-based reporting
- `Line 41-43`: Defines three-level sorting priority (DonorKey, Surname, Firstname) for report organization
