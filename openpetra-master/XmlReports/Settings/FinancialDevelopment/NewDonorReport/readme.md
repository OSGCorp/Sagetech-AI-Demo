# XML New Donor Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML New Donor Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra's financial development module. This subproject implements standardized donor reporting capabilities through XML-based configuration, allowing for consistent and customizable presentation of new donor information. The architecture follows a declarative approach where report behavior and appearance are defined through structured XML configuration rather than hard-coded logic.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable donor information reporting with customizable parameters
- Flexible sorting mechanisms (primarily by partner name)
- Parameterized filtering of donor data based on gift dates, amounts, and other criteria
- Standardized column layout and formatting for financial development reports
- Currency-aware display formatting for monetary values

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, parameters, and behavior without requiring code changes
2. **Parameter-Driven Filtering**: Implements configurable thresholds and date ranges to control which donors appear in reports
3. **Flexible Column Configuration**: Provides detailed control over column widths, content, and formatting
4. **Motivation Grouping**: Supports categorization of donors based on motivation groups and details
5. **Integration with Financial Development Module**: Connects donor information with the broader financial tracking capabilities of OpenPetra

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, allowing for report customization without programming. The standard.xml file serves as the central definition point for report behavior, establishing a clear separation between reporting logic and presentation details. This approach enables administrators to modify report appearance and filtering criteria without developer intervention, while maintaining consistent formatting and calculation methods across the financial development module.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the New Donor Report in OpenPetra's financial development module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the New Donor Report in OpenPetra's financial development module. It specifies system settings, XML file dependencies, report identification, and display configurations. The file establishes sorting preferences by partner name, calculation methods, and column settings for displaying donor information. Parameters include gift date, recipient details, motivation groups/details, and gift amounts. The configuration controls column widths, currency formatting, and filtering options like minimum amount thresholds. These settings determine how new donor information is presented in financial development reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report definition logic
- `Line 7`: Limits display columns to 8, controlling the report's visual presentation
- `Line 9`: Uses 'Base' currency parameter for standardized financial reporting
- `Line 11-38`: Defines a structured column layout with specific widths and calculation methods for each data point
- `Line 40`: Designates column 7 as the gift amount column for financial calculations
