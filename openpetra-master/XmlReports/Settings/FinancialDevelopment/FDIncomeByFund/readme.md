# XML Income By Fund Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Income By Fund Report is a specialized reporting module within OpenPetra that generates financial development reports organized by fund. This component is configured through XML-based definitions that establish the structure, calculations, and presentation of fund-based income data. The report primarily focuses on financial development metrics with support for multiple calculation types and comparative analysis.

## Key Technical Features

- Configurable multi-column financial reporting (8 display columns)
- GiftsByMotivation calculation engine for donation analysis
- Period-based financial comparisons (current vs. previous periods)
- Year-to-Date (YTD) calculation support
- Percentage-based financial analysis
- Hierarchical account structure representation
- Customizable column widths and formatting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Driven Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, calculations, and display parameters
2. **Flexible Period Handling**: Supports various time ranges and comparative period analysis
3. **Motivation Filtering**: Allows filtering of financial data based on gift motivation categories
4. **Hierarchical Data Presentation**: Configurable display depth for account hierarchies
5. **Currency Formatting**: Standardized currency display with configurable formatting options

## Architecture Overview

The report module follows OpenPetra's configuration-driven architecture, where the standard.xml file serves as the blueprint for report generation. The system processes this configuration to query financial data, perform calculations based on specified parameters, and render the results according to the defined column structure. This approach enables non-technical users to modify report behavior through configuration rather than code changes, while maintaining consistent financial calculation logic across the application.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Financial Development Income By Fund report defining calculation parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Financial Development Income By Fund report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, and report configuration with 8 display columns. The file configures different calculation types (primarily GiftsByMotivation) with various parameters including period ranges, motivation filters, YTD calculations, and column widths. It sets up columns for Support, Field, Total income, and percentage calculations, with both regular and year-to-date versions. Additional parameters define account hierarchy, currency format, and display depth settings.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 8-10`: Defines period range parameters that control the financial reporting timeframe
- `Line 11-21`: First column configuration shows pattern for filtering gifts by specific motivations
- `Line 22-32`: Second column uses exclude_motivation parameter to filter out specific gift types
- `Line 39-42`: Percentage calculation columns reference other columns using FirstColumn parameter
