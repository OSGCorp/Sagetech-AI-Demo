# XML SYBUNT Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a .NET-based program that provides comprehensive administrative management for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and donor relationship management through a modular architecture. This sub-project implements specialized financial reporting capabilities focused on donor retention analysis along with XML-based configuration for customizable report generation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- SYBUNT (Some Year But Unfortunately Not This) donor analysis reporting
- Configurable financial development tracking
- Parameterized report generation for donor retention metrics
- Multi-currency gift amount formatting and thresholds

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Configuration: The system uses declarative XML structures to define report parameters, data sources, and display formats without requiring code changes
2. Columnar Data Organization: Reports are structured with eight standard columns including Partner Key, Partner Name, Partner Class, and financial metrics
3. Flexible Parameter System: System parameters control report behavior including date ranges, minimum thresholds, and comparison periods
4. Financial Data Formatting: Specialized handling for currency values ensures consistent presentation across different monetary amounts

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over coding through the XML definition files, allowing for report customization without modifying application code. The SYBUNT report specifically targets donor retention analysis by comparing giving patterns across different time periods. The system supports internationalization through currency formatting options and provides flexible sorting and filtering capabilities. This report module integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial management system while maintaining a focused purpose of identifying donors who have given in previous years but not in the current period.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the SYBUNT (Some Year But Unfortunately Not This) financial development report.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the SYBUNT (Some Year But Unfortunately Not This) financial development report in OpenPetra. It configures report settings including system parameters, XML data sources, column definitions, and display properties. The file specifies eight display columns showing Partner Key, Partner Name, Partner Class, Number, Last Gift Date, Motivation Detail, Motivation Group, and Last Gift Amount. It also defines sorting preferences, currency formatting, minimum amount thresholds, and year parameters for comparing donor giving patterns between specified years.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: References external XML files (lybunt.xml and common.xml) for additional report configuration
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 8, controlling report layout complexity
- `Line 44`: Implements multi-level sorting with readable descriptions and column references
- `Line 47`: Supports currency formatting with CurrencyComplete parameter
