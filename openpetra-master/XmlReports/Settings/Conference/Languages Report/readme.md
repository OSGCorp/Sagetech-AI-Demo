# XML Conference Languages Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Languages Report is a specialized configuration component within OpenPetra's reporting infrastructure that generates language-related data for conference management. This subproject implements standardized report configuration through XML-based parameter definitions, providing conference organizers with language proficiency insights across attendees. The configuration framework connects the reporting engine with underlying data sources to produce consistent, filterable reports.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration architecture for report parameter definition
- Integration with dual data sources (languagesreport.xml and conference.xml)
- Parameterized filtering for conference selection and attendee criteria
- Partner key and extract name configuration for data contextualization
- Standardized report template definition for consistent output formatting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Uses XML schema to define report behavior without code changes
2. **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combines language proficiency data with conference registration information
3. **Parameterized Filtering System**: Enables dynamic report generation based on configurable criteria
4. **Standardized Report Template**: Ensures consistent formatting and presentation across generated reports
5. **Infrastructure Layer Integration**: Functions within OpenPetra's broader configuration management system

## Architecture Overview

The subproject follows a configuration-as-code approach, where report definitions are externalized in XML rather than hardcoded. This promotes maintainability by separating report logic from presentation concerns. The standard.xml file serves as the configuration template that the reporting engine interprets to generate appropriate outputs for conference language reporting needs.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the Conference Languages Report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Languages Report' in the Conference module of OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources (languagesreport.xml and conference.xml), report name, and various parameters controlling report behavior. Parameters include conference and attendee selection criteria, partner key, and extract name. The file serves as a standard configuration template that determines how the Languages Report will be generated and displayed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data files that provide the actual report content and conference data.
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter set to 0 suggests dynamic column handling in the report rendering.
