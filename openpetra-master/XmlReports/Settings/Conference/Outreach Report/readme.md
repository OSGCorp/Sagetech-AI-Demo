# XML Conference Outreach Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. The XML Conference Outreach Report subproject implements a specialized reporting module for tracking conference participation and outreach activities. This subproject provides a structured approach to generating detailed participant reports with configurable parameters and formatting options.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration framework for flexible report definition
- Parameterized report generation with 14 configurable data columns
- Support for complex participant data including personal details, travel information, and financial status
- Hierarchical data organization with multiple detail levels
- Conditional formatting and calculation capabilities for financial reporting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Uses XML schema to define report structure, allowing for modification without code changes
2. **Column-Based Data Architecture**: Implements a flexible column system with configurable widths and calculation types
3. **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Supports complex filtering by conference criteria, participant status, and outreach codes
4. **Integrated Financial Reporting**: Connects participant data with financial systems for comprehensive status reporting
5. **Missing Information Tracking**: Specialized functionality to identify incomplete participant records

## Technical Implementation

The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design supports extensibility through parameter modification rather than code changes, making it adaptable to changing reporting requirements while maintaining the core processing logic.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Conference Outreach Report defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Outreach Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report type, and display options. The file configures 14 columns with their respective widths and calculation types, including Partner Name, Gender, Marital Status, Passport Number, Age, Arrival/Departure Dates, Conference Role, Application Status, Outreach Code, Fellowship Group, Missing Information, and Finance Details. It also includes parameters for report detail level, financial reporting options, and conference selection criteria.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Root Parameters element contains all configuration settings for the report
- `Line 4`: References external XML files (outreachreport.xml and conference.xml) as data sources
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns (14) for the report layout
- `Line 19-40`: Column definitions with calculation types and precise width specifications using decimal values
- `Line 15-18`: Report options controlling financial reporting, applications display, and sign-off lines
