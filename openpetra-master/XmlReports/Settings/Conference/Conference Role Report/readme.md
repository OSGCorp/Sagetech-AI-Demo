# XML Conference Role Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Role Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates structured statistical data about conference attendee roles. This subproject implements conference role analysis capabilities along with configurable report formatting and filtering options. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Statistical breakdown of conference roles by demographic categories
- Configurable column display for role analysis (Code, Total, Female, Male, Couple, Family)
- Parameterized filtering by conference and attendee attributes
- Standardized report formatting consistent with OpenPetra's reporting framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The report structure, parameters, and display options are defined through XML configuration files, allowing for flexible customization without code changes
2. **Demographic Data Segmentation**: The architecture supports breaking down conference role data across multiple demographic dimensions (gender, relationship status)
3. **Consistent Column Formatting**: The report maintains uniform column widths (value of 2) across all data categories for visual consistency
4. **Parameter-Driven Filtering**: The report engine processes conference and attendee selection parameters to generate targeted role analysis

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's configuration-driven reporting framework, where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This approach separates the report structure from the processing logic, enhancing maintainability. The Conference Role Report specifically focuses on statistical analysis of conference participation by role categories, providing administrators with demographic insights into conference attendance patterns. The standardized column structure ensures consistent data presentation while the parameterized filtering enables flexible report generation based on specific administrative needs.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Conference Role Report defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Role Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, report name, and display configuration. The file sets up report filtering options including conference and attendee selection parameters. It configures six display columns (Code, Total, Female, Male, Couple, Family) with their respective widths, each set to a value of 2. These parameters control how conference role data is filtered, calculated, and displayed in the generated report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables access to global configuration
- `Line 4`: References external XML file containing the report definition structure
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum number of columns that can be displayed in the report
- `Line 11-13`: Conference selection parameters allow filtering by specific conference key or name
