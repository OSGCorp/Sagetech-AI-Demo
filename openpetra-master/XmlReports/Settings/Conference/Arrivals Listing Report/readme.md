# XML Conference Arrival Listing Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Arrival Listing Report is a configuration-driven component that generates structured listings of conference attendee arrival information within the OpenPetra system. This subproject implements standardized report definition and rendering capabilities through XML configuration, enabling administrators to track and manage conference participant logistics efficiently.

The report configuration provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured data presentation with consistent column formatting
- Multiple sorting options (Partner Name, Nationality, Charged Office)
- Comprehensive attendee logistics tracking
- Standardized report parameter definitions

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, columns, and sorting preferences without requiring code changes
2. Typed Parameter System: Supports multiple data types (eString, eInteger, eDecimal, eBoolean) for proper data validation and display
3. Flexible Column Configuration: Nine configurable columns with defined widths for consistent report formatting
4. Hierarchical Sorting: Implements multi-level sorting priorities to organize attendee information logically

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's configuration-driven reporting framework, separating report definition from implementation logic. The standard.xml configuration file serves as the single source of truth for report structure, ensuring consistent output across the application. The report focuses on critical arrival logistics including transportation needs, room assignments, and timing details, enabling conference administrators to efficiently manage participant arrivals and resource allocation.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Conference Arrivals Listing Report in OpenPetra, defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Arrivals Listing Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file dependencies, report identification, and display configuration. The file sets up sorting preferences (by Partner Name, Nationality, and Charged Office) and defines nine columns with their respective widths: Partner Name, Passport Number, Age, Gender, Charged Office, Conference Room, Arrival Needs Transport, Arrival Details, and Arrival Time. Each parameter includes an ID, column reference where applicable, and typed values (eString, eInteger, eDecimal, eBoolean) for proper data handling.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses systemsettings parameter to enable system-wide configuration access
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide data structures for the report
- `Line 14-16`: Implements a three-level sorting mechanism with readable and column-indexed references
- `Line 17-35`: Defines nine columns with specific width settings using different numeric formats (eInteger and eDecimal)
