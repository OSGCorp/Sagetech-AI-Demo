# XML Conference Sending Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Sending Field Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates detailed participant information for conferences and events. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that extracts, formats, and presents attendee data from the OpenPetra database system. The implementation relies on XML configuration files to define report parameters, data sources, and display settings, enabling flexible report generation without code changes.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable attendee data extraction based on multiple filtering criteria
- Customizable report detail levels for different administrative needs
- Flexible column configuration for displaying participant information
- Support for critical conference management data points including personal details, travel information, and financial status

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Driven Configuration: Uses declarative XML files to define report structure, data sources, and display parameters without requiring code changes
2. Parameter-Based Filtering: Implements configurable filtering for conference selection, attendee status, and data inclusion
3. Column-Based Data Presentation: Supports 13 distinct data columns with configurable widths and display properties
4. Integrated Data Sourcing: Connects to OpenPetra's core database to extract relevant participant information across multiple data domains

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, with the standard.xml file serving as the central definition point for report behavior. The system separates data sourcing, filtering logic, and presentation concerns, making the report highly adaptable to different conference management scenarios. The implementation integrates with OpenPetra's broader data model while providing specialized views for conference administration needs. This design allows for straightforward maintenance and extension of report capabilities without disrupting the core system.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Sending Field Report in OpenPetra's Conference module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Sending Field Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report details, and display configurations. The file sets default values for conference selection, attendee filtering, report detail level, and various display options. It defines 13 data columns with their respective widths, including Partner Name, Gender, Marital Status, Passport Number, Age, Arrival/Departure Dates, Conference Role, Application Status, Outreach Code, Fellowship Group, Missing Information, and Finance Details. The parameters control both the data content and visual presentation of the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Root Parameters element contains all configuration settings for this report
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the data structure for the report
- `Line 7`: Defines maximum number of displayable columns (14) for the report
- `Line 15`: Configures report detail level with multiple options available
- `Line 19`: Controls financial reporting options with boolean flags
