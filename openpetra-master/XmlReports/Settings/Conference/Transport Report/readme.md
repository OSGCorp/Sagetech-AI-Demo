# XML Conference Transportation Report

The XML Conference Transportation Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized transportation reports for conference management. This subproject implements XML-based report definitions that enable conference organizers to track, manage, and coordinate participant transportation needs for both arrivals and departures.

The architecture is based on declarative XML configuration files that define:

- Report parameters and system settings
- Data sources and filtering options
- Column definitions and display formats
- Sorting preferences and calculation rules

## Key Technical Features

- **Parameterized Report Generation**: Configurable filters for showing specific transportation needs (e.g., only travel days, incomplete details)
- **Flexible Data Presentation**: Customizable column widths and display formats
- **Multi-directional Transport Management**: Separate configurations for arrival and departure logistics
- **Sorting Capabilities**: Multi-level sorting by date, time, and participant information
- **Conditional Display Logic**: Rules for showing/hiding participants based on transport requirements

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Report definitions are externalized in XML files, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. **Standardized Report Structure**: Consistent approach to defining both arrival and departure reports
3. **Parameter-Driven Filtering**: Extensive filtering options to narrow down displayed transportation data
4. **Column Width Management**: Precise control over report formatting for optimal readability
5. **Calculation Fields**: Support for derived data fields based on underlying participant information

The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, allowing for report customization without programming. The XML definitions serve as templates that the OpenPetra reporting engine processes to generate the final reports for conference transportation coordination.

## Business Functions

### Transportation Reports
- `standard Departure.xml` : XML configuration file for a standard departure transport report in the Conference module of OpenPetra.
- `standard Arrival.xml` : XML configuration file for a conference transport arrival report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard Arrival.xml

This XML file defines parameters for a conference transport arrival report in OpenPetra. It configures system settings, XML data sources, report display options, and sorting preferences. The file specifies column calculations for displaying attendee information including partner names, arrival dates/times, transport needs, arrival points, and other travel details. It also defines column widths for proper report formatting and includes filter parameters for attendee selection, conference selection, and transport requirements. The configuration supports sorting by arrival date, time, and partner name.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Defines system settings and XML data sources that provide the underlying data structure for the report
- `Line 13-16`: Configures three-level sorting hierarchy for the report data
- `Line 21-23`: Implements filtering options for arrivals, travel days, and transport needs
- `Line 24-42`: Defines a 9-column report layout with specific width allocations for each data element
### standard Departure.xml

This XML file defines parameters for a Conference Transport Report focused on departures. It configures report settings including system parameters, XML data sources, sorting preferences, and column definitions. The file specifies sorting by departure date, time, and partner name, with display columns for partner information, departure details, transport needs, and expected arrival times. Parameters control filtering options such as showing only travel days, attendees needing transport, or those with incomplete details. The configuration supports customized column widths for optimal report formatting.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Links to external XML data sources that provide the actual report data
- `Line 12-17`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for organizing transport information
- `Line 19-21`: Configurable radio button options for filtering between arrivals and departures
- `Line 24-41`: Defines a structured column layout with precise width specifications for report formatting
