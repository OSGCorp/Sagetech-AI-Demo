# XML Conference Children Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source administration system that helps non-profit organizations manage their operations and reduce costs. This sub-project implements the XML Conference Children Report functionality, which provides specialized reporting capabilities for tracking and managing children attending conferences. The implementation uses XML configuration to define report parameters and display settings.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Conference attendee filtering by age range (specifically targeting 0-17 years)
- Customizable sorting options (by age, partner name, arrival date)
- Comprehensive display of child attendee information
- Structured data representation for reporting purposes

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report parameters, data sources, and display settings without requiring code changes
2. **Flexible Sorting Mechanisms**: Implements multiple sorting options to allow different views of the same dataset
3. **Columnar Data Representation**: Defines 11 specific data columns with precise width specifications for consistent reporting
4. **Age-Based Filtering**: Implements specific filtering logic to identify and report on minor attendees
5. **Integration with Conference Module**: Connects with the broader conference management functionality of OpenPetra

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design enables non-technical users to modify report parameters without changing application code. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both data acquisition parameters and presentation specifications. This approach supports maintainability while providing the specialized reporting needs for tracking children at conferences, including critical information like passport numbers, room assignments, and arrival/departure dates.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Conference Children Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Children Report' in the Conference module of OpenPetra. It specifies report settings including system parameters, XML data sources, and display configuration. The file configures sorting options (by age, partner name, and arrival date), age range filters (0-17 years), and defines 11 display columns with their respective widths. Each column represents specific attendee information such as partner name, passport number, age, gender, charged office, outreach code, conference room, fellowship group, arrival/departure dates, and conference role.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Defines system settings and XML data sources that power the report
- `Line 11-20`: Configures three-level sorting hierarchy with readable labels and column mappings
- `Line 21-22`: Sets age range filter specifically for children (0-17 years)
- `Line 23-43`: Defines 11 display columns with precise width specifications using different numeric formats
