# XML Conference Attendee Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source administration system that helps non-profit organizations manage their operations efficiently. This sub-project implements the XML Conference Attendee Report functionality, providing a structured way to generate and display conference participant information. This component delivers these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- XML-based report configuration for conference attendee data
- Flexible sorting options (Partner Name, Partner Key, Age)
- Customizable column display with precise width specifications
- Comprehensive attendee information presentation

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML Configuration Framework: Uses a standardized XML structure to define report parameters, ensuring consistency across the reporting system
2. Multi-dimensional Data Organization: Supports various sorting methods to accommodate different administrative needs
3. Flexible Column Configuration: Each data field has configurable display properties including width and calculation parameters
4. Conference Management Integration: Connects with the broader conference management functionality of OpenPetra

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report structure and behavior are defined in XML rather than code. This design enables non-technical users to modify report layouts without programming knowledge. The standard.xml file serves as the blueprint for attendee reports, defining both data sources and presentation logic. The component integrates with OpenPetra's partner management system to pull relevant attendee information including personal details, accommodation assignments, and conference roles, presenting this data in a structured format suitable for administrative purposes.

## Business Functions

### XML Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Present Attendee Report in OpenPetra's conference management system.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Present Attendee Report in OpenPetra's conference management system. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report name, and display configuration. The file configures sorting options (by Partner Name, Partner Key, and Age) and defines 12 display columns including Partner Name, Passport Number, Age, Gender, Charged Office, Outreach Code, Conference Room, Fellowship Group, Group Leader, Arrival/Departure Dates, and Conference Role. Each column has specified widths and calculation parameters to control data presentation in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Defines system settings and XML data sources that provide the underlying data structure for the report
- `Line 12-21`: Implements a multi-level sorting mechanism with both readable descriptions and column references
- `Line 22-45`: Uses a column-based parameter system with calculation types and precise width specifications using both integer and decimal values
