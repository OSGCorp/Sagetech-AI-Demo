## XML Conference Charged Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Charged Field Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra system that generates detailed financial and attendance reports for conference management. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that processes conference attendee data and produces standardized outputs for administrative and financial tracking purposes. The implementation leverages XML-based configuration to define report parameters, data sources, and output formatting.

### Key Technical Features

- XML-driven report configuration with 13 customizable data columns
- Partner and attendee data integration with financial tracking capabilities
- Flexible filtering options for conference selection and attendee categorization
- Configurable display settings for various report detail levels
- Financial calculation support for conference fees and extra costs

### Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML configuration files to define report structure, data sources, and display parameters without requiring code changes
2. **Columnar Data Architecture**: Implements a flexible column-based reporting system with configurable widths and calculations
3. **Multi-dimensional Data Integration**: Combines partner information, conference attendance details, and financial data into cohesive reports
4. **Conditional Reporting Logic**: Supports filtering based on application status, conference roles, and financial parameters

The architecture follows OpenPetra's configuration-driven approach, allowing for extensive customization without code modifications. The reporting engine processes the XML configuration to generate reports that can be used for financial reconciliation, attendance tracking, and administrative purposes in conference management workflows.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Conference Charged Field Report defining parameters, calculations, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Charged Field Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report type, and display configuration. The file contains parameters for conference and attendee selection, partner information, and report detail level. It configures 13 data columns with their calculations and widths, including Partner Name, Gender, Marital Status, Passport Number, Age, Arrival/Departure Dates, Conference Role, Application Status, Outreach Code, Fellowship Group, Missing Information, and Finance Details. The file also includes options for financial reporting, accepted applications, extra costs, and sign-off lines.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the data structure for the report
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns (14) which limits the report's visual structure
- `Line 15-19`: Contains boolean parameters that control which sections of the report are generated
- `Line 21-42`: Defines column calculations and widths using a dual-parameter system with column indexes
