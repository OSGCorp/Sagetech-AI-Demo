# XML Conference Arrival Departure Group

The XML Conference Arrival Departure Group is a configuration-driven reporting component of OpenPetra that manages arrival and departure information for conference attendees. This subproject implements standardized report definitions through XML configuration files that control data presentation and filtering capabilities for conference logistics management.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable report generation for arrival and departure logistics
- Standardized column definitions with customizable widths
- Flexible attendee filtering and grouping mechanisms
- Parameterized data selection for conference management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Report definitions are externalized in XML files, allowing for customization without code changes
2. **Standardized Parameter Structure**: Each report uses consistent parameter definitions with IDs, value types, and specific configurations
3. **Column-Based Data Presentation**: Reports are structured around predefined columns with specified widths for consistent display
4. **Group-Based Filtering**: The architecture supports filtering attendees by groups (e.g., DepartureGroup) with options to include attendees without groups

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, separating report definitions from the application logic. The XML files serve as templates that define both the data sources and presentation format. This design enables easy modification of reports without requiring code changes, while maintaining consistent structure across different report types. The configuration parameters provide fine-grained control over data selection, filtering, and display options, making the system adaptable to various conference management scenarios.

## Business Functions

### Conference Management
- `standard Departure.xml` : Configuration file for Conference Departure Group report defining parameters and column settings.
- `standard Arrival.xml` : XML configuration file for the Arrival Departure Group report in OpenPetra, defining display parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard Arrival.xml

This XML file configures the Arrival Departure Group report in OpenPetra's conference management system. It defines report parameters including system settings, XML data sources, conference and attendee selection criteria, and display options. The file specifies eight display columns with their respective widths: Partner Name, Charged Office, Arrival Date, Arrival Time, Arrival Needs Transport, Arrival Point, Arrival Type, and Arrival Details. Each parameter has an ID, value type, and specific configuration that controls how arrival information is presented in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the data structure for the report
- `Line 11`: Parameter 'param_rgrGroupType' set to 'ArrivalGroup' determines the report's focus on arrival information
- `Line 12`: Boolean parameter controls inclusion of attendees without group assignments
### standard Departure.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Arrival Departure Group' report with a focus on departure information. It specifies system settings, XML files to use, conference and attendee selection parameters, and configures eight display columns with their respective widths. The columns include Partner Name, Charged Office, Departure Date, Departure Time, Departure Needs Transport, Departure Point, Departure Type, and Departure Details. The file sets 'DepartureGroup' as the group type and enables inclusion of attendees without groups.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the core report structure and conference data
- `Line 11`: Uses param_rgrGroupType to specifically configure this as a departure-focused report variant
- `Line 12`: Includes a boolean parameter to control whether attendees without group assignments should appear in the report
