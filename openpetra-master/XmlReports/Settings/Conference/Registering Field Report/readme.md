# XML Conference Registering Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Registering Field Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that handles conference registration data processing and presentation. This subproject implements XML-based configuration for structured reporting of conference attendee information, along with flexible data filtering and formatting capabilities. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable report generation for conference registration data
- Structured data presentation with customizable columns and widths
- Comprehensive filtering options for targeted reporting
- Support for both attendee personal details and financial information

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Driven Configuration: Uses declarative XML structure to define report parameters, data sources, and display options without requiring code changes
2. Flexible Data Filtering: Implements multiple filtering dimensions including conference selection, attendee attributes, and financial status
3. Standardized Column Definition: Maintains consistent data presentation through predefined column specifications with controlled widths
4. Integrated Financial Reporting: Combines personal attendee information with financial status data in a unified report format

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where the `standard.xml` file serves as the central definition point for report structure and behavior. This design separates reporting logic from presentation concerns, enabling non-technical users to modify report parameters. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader data management capabilities while focusing specifically on conference registration workflows. The column-based output format supports both operational needs (tracking registrations) and administrative requirements (financial reconciliation), making it a versatile tool within the nonprofit management ecosystem.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Conference Registering Field Report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Registering Field Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report type, and display options. The file configures report filtering options including conference selection, attendee selection, and financial reporting preferences. It defines 13 data columns with their respective widths, including Partner Name, Gender, Marital Status, Passport Number, Age, Arrival/Departure Dates, Conference Role, Application Status, Outreach Code, Fellowship Group, Missing Information, and Finance Details. These parameters control both the data selection and visual presentation of the conference registration report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables access to global configuration
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual data structure and conference definitions
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns (14) which limits the report width
- `Line 15`: Financial report checkbox is enabled by default while other report options are disabled
- `Line 18`: Column widths use both integer and decimal notation for different precision requirements
