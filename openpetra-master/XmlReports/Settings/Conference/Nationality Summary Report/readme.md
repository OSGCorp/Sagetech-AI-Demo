# XML Conference Nationality Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Nationality Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates structured nationality distribution data for conference attendees. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that processes attendee demographic information and presents it in a standardized format. The implementation provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Nationality-based demographic analysis of conference participants
- Gender distribution reporting across different nationalities
- Language distribution tracking for conference planning
- Configurable column layout with predefined width parameters

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The reporting structure is defined through XML configuration files that specify column layouts, widths, and calculation types
2. **Parameterized Report Generation**: Reports can be customized through parameters for conference selection and attendee filtering
3. **Multi-dimensional Data Analysis**: The system correlates nationality data with gender and language information
4. **Fixed Column Structure**: Implements a standardized 6-column layout (Nationalities, Total, Female, Male, Other, Languages) with predefined widths

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach where report structure and behavior are defined in XML rather than code. This design enables non-technical users to adjust report parameters while maintaining consistent output formats. The nationality report serves as a critical tool for conference organizers to understand participant demographics, plan language services, and ensure appropriate accommodations. The fixed column structure balances consistency with flexibility, allowing for standardized reporting across different conference instances.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration for the Nationality Summary Report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Nationality Summary Report in the Conference module of OpenPetra. It configures system settings, XML file paths, and report display options. The file specifies a maximum of 6 display columns and sets default parameters for conference and attendee selection. It defines column structure with specific widths for displaying nationality data: Nationalities, Total, Female, Male, Other, and Languages. Each column has an assigned calculation type and width parameter to control the report layout and presentation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'nationalitysummaryreport.xml' that likely contains the report structure definition
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 6 columns, matching the defined column configurations
- `Line 11-12`: Conference parameters allow dynamic selection of conference data to report on
