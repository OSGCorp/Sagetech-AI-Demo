# XML Conference Extra Costs Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Extra Costs Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates detailed financial reports for conference-related extra costs. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that processes financial data related to conference expenses and presents it in a structured format. The implementation relies on XML configuration to define report parameters, data sources, and presentation options.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Detailed tracking of conference-related expenses
- Partner-specific cost reporting
- Multi-level sorting of financial data
- Configurable display options for cost reporting
- Standardized formatting of financial information
- Authorization tracking for conference expenses

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, data sources, and display parameters without requiring code changes
2. Hierarchical Data Organization: Implements three-level sorting (Cost Type, Amount, Partner Name) for logical data presentation
3. Columnar Data Presentation: Structures data into six standardized columns with defined widths for consistent reporting
4. Parameter-Driven Filtering: Supports configurable filtering options to customize report output based on user requirements
5. Integration with Partner Data: Links expense information with partner records for comprehensive reporting

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined through XML parameters rather than hard-coded logic. This design promotes flexibility and maintainability by separating report configuration from processing logic. The standardized column structure ensures consistent presentation while the multi-level sorting provides logical organization of financial data. The report integrates with OpenPetra's partner management system to provide context for expense information and supports authorization tracking for financial governance.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Conference Extra Costs Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Conference Extra Costs Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report name, display options, and filtering parameters. The file configures sorting preferences with three levels of ordering (Cost Type, Amount, Partner Name) and defines six report columns with their respective widths: Partner Name, Cost Type, Amount, Authorising Field, Authorising Person, and Cost Type Comment. Each parameter has an ID, data type, and value that controls how the report is generated and displayed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data files that provide the actual report data
- `Line 10-14`: Conference selection parameters allow filtering by specific conference or partner
- `Line 15-19`: Three-level sorting configuration with readable description and column references
- `Line 22-33`: Column definitions with width specifications using different numeric formats (Integer and Decimal)
