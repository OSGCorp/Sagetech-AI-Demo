# XML Conference Age Summary Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Age Summary Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that provides demographic analysis capabilities for conference management. This subproject implements structured age-based demographic reporting with configurable data aggregation and presentation options. The component processes attendee data to generate statistical breakdowns by gender and age categories, supporting OpenPetra's broader conference management functionality.

## Key Technical Features

- Configurable demographic data aggregation with gender-specific breakdowns (Total, Female, Male, Other)
- XML-driven parameter configuration for flexible report customization
- Column width specifications for consistent report formatting
- Attendee filtering capabilities for targeted demographic analysis
- Partner key and extract name parameter handling for data source identification

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses standard.xml to define all report parameters, calculations, and display options
2. **Demographic Data Processing**: Implements specialized calculations for age-based demographic breakdowns
3. **Conference Selection Modes**: Supports various methods for identifying and filtering conference data
4. **Integration with Partner System**: Connects with OpenPetra's partner management system through partner key references

## Architecture
The subproject follows OpenPetra's infrastructure configuration pattern for reports, using XML-defined parameters to control report generation. This approach separates configuration from implementation, allowing for customization without code changes while maintaining consistent report structures across the application.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Conference Age Summary Report parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Conference Age Summary Report in OpenPetra. It configures system settings, XML data sources, report identification, and display options. The file specifies column calculations for age demographics (Total, Female, Male, Other) with their respective column widths. It also includes parameters for conference selection mode, attendee filtering options, partner key, and extract name settings. These parameters control how age data is aggregated and presented in the report output.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data sources that provide the actual conference and age summary data
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 5 columns of demographic data
- `Line 9-10`: Parameters for filtering attendees and selecting specific conferences
