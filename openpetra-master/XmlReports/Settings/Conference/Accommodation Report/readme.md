# XML Conference Accommodation Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Accommodation Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra system that generates structured accommodation data for conference management. This subproject implements XML-based configuration and templating for accommodation reporting along with parameter-driven data extraction and formatting capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Parameterized report generation for conference accommodation data
- Configurable column calculations for Room, CheckDate, and Cost metrics
- Three-column layout system with customizable formatting and widths
- Flexible filtering mechanisms for conference and attendee selection

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining all report parameters, data sources, and formatting rules
2. **Calculation Framework**: Built-in support for specialized column calculations that process accommodation data into meaningful metrics
3. **Filtering System**: Implements partner key value filtering and conference selection mechanisms to narrow report scope
4. **Formatting Controls**: Provides precise control over column widths, layout, and visual presentation of accommodation data

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative XML approach to report definition, separating the report structure from the underlying data processing logic. The configuration system allows for extensive customization without code changes, supporting the non-profit focus of OpenPetra by enabling flexible reporting for different conference scenarios. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader data management capabilities while maintaining a focused purpose of tracking and reporting accommodation arrangements for conference attendees.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Conference Accommodation Report settings in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Conference Accommodation Report in OpenPetra. It configures system settings, XML data sources, column calculations for Room, CheckDate, and Cost, column widths, and report display options. The file sets up a three-column report layout with specific formatting parameters and filtering options for conference selection, attendee selection, and partner key values. These parameters control how accommodation data is presented and calculated in the generated report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the data structure for the report
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns as 3, limiting the report layout
- `Line 7-11`: Configures calculation parameters for each column with specific width settings
