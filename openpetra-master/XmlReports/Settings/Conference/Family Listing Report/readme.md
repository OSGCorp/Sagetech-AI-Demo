# XML Conference Family Listing Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Family Listing Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates structured family listings for conference management. This sub-project implements XML-based report definition and rendering capabilities along with parameter-controlled data presentation for conference attendee information. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable columnar report generation for conference family data
- Standardized display formatting for attendee information
- Parameter-driven report customization
- XML-based configuration for consistent report structure

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML Configuration Framework: The standard.xml file defines the report structure, allowing for declarative configuration rather than hard-coded report layouts
2. Parameterized Report Generation: The system uses defined parameters with specific data types to control report behavior and appearance
3. Multi-column Data Presentation: Supports 11 distinct data columns with configurable widths for comprehensive attendee information display
4. Conference-specific Data Integration: Connects to OpenPetra's core data structures to pull relevant conference participant information

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, with XML definitions determining report structure and appearance. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both data sources and presentation details. This design enables non-programmers to modify report layouts and included fields without code changes. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader conference management functionality while maintaining a clean separation between data retrieval, business logic, and presentation concerns.

## Business Functions

### Conference Management
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Family Listing Report in the Conference module of OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Family Listing Report in OpenPetra's Conference module. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, and report display properties. The file configures 11 display columns with their respective widths, including Partner Name, Passport Number, Age, Gender, Charged Office, Outreach Code, Conference Room, Fellowship Group, Arrival Date, Departure Date, and Conference Role. Each parameter has an ID, data type, and value that control how the report is generated and displayed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: References external XML files that provide data for the report
- `Line 5-7`: Defines core report configuration including maximum column count
- `Line 12-14`: Parameters for conference selection that allow filtering report data
- `Line 15-35`: Column definitions with width specifications using different numeric formats (Integer and Decimal)
