# XML Conference Absentee Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage administrative tasks and reduce operational overhead. The XML Conference Absentee Report subproject implements specialized reporting functionality for tracking conference attendance information. This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured reporting of conference absentee data through XML configuration
- Customizable display of attendee information with 12 configurable columns
- Flexible data filtering and sorting mechanisms for attendance analysis
- Integration with the broader conference management functionality

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Driven Configuration**: The reporting structure is defined through XML configuration files that specify data sources, display parameters, and calculation types
2. **Parameterized Reporting**: The system supports dynamic report generation based on conference selection, attendee filtering, and sorting preferences
3. **Standardized Column Definitions**: Predefined column configurations handle various data types including personal information, logistical details, and organizational roles
4. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: The architecture supports multi-level data relationships between partners, conferences, and attendance records

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design promotes maintainability by separating report structure from application logic. The standard.xml configuration file serves as the blueprint for report generation, defining both data acquisition parameters and presentation formatting. The system integrates with OpenPetra's partner management and conference organization modules to provide comprehensive absentee tracking capabilities while maintaining consistency with the broader application's data model and user experience.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Conference Absentee Report defining parameters, calculations, and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Conference Absentee Report in OpenPetra. It specifies XML data sources, report settings, and display configurations. The file sets up report parameters including conference selection options, attendee filtering, sorting preferences, and column definitions. It configures 12 display columns with specific widths and calculation types, including Partner Name, Passport Number, Age, Gender, Charged Office, Outreach Code, Conference Room, Fellowship Group, Group Leader, Arrival/Departure Dates, and Conference Role. The file also defines three ordering fields used for sorting the report data.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Root Parameters element contains all configuration settings for the report
- `Line 3`: References external XML data files that provide the actual report data
- `Line 20-22`: Defines hidden calculation columns (12-14) used for sorting but not displayed
- `Line 24-45`: Configures 12 visible columns with specific width settings and calculation types
