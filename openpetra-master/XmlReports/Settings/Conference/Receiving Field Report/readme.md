# XML Conference Receiving Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Receiving Field Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized field reports for conference management. The subproject implements XML-based report definition and rendering capabilities, allowing conference administrators to track attendee details and status information. This configuration-driven approach provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Flexible report configuration through XML definition files
- Standardized conference attendee tracking and reporting
- Customizable column definitions with specific width and calculation parameters
- Integrated financial reporting for conference participants

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML Configuration Framework: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, data sources, and display parameters without requiring code changes
2. Multi-dimensional Data Integration: Combines partner information, conference roles, financial status, and logistical details into unified reports
3. Parameterized Reporting: Supports filtering by conference selection, attendee criteria, and detail level options
4. Column-based Data Presentation: Implements a 13-column structure covering biographical, logistical, and financial dimensions

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, with the `standard.xml` file serving as the central definition point for report behavior. The system integrates with OpenPetra's partner management and financial modules to provide comprehensive conference management capabilities. The reporting framework is designed for flexibility, allowing administrators to adjust display parameters and data inclusion without technical intervention. This subproject exemplifies OpenPetra's commitment to providing non-profit organizations with powerful administrative tools that can be customized to specific operational needs.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Conference Receiving Field Report in OpenPetra, defining report parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Conference Receiving Field Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report display options, and column configurations. The file sets parameters for conference and attendee selection, report detail level, and financial reporting options. It defines 13 columns with their respective calculations and widths, including Partner Name, Gender, Marital Status, Passport Number, Age, Arrival/Departure Dates, Conference Role, Application Status, Outreach Code, Fellowship Group, Missing Information, and Finance Details.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-4`: Links to external XML data sources that provide the actual report data
- `Line 5-6`: Defines report name and maximum column display limit
- `Line 15-18`: Controls report detail level and financial reporting options
- `Line 22-43`: Defines column calculations and widths using scientific notation for decimal values
