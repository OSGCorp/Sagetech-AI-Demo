# XML Conference Attendance Summary Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Conference Attendance Summary Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates structured attendance data for conferences and events managed by non-profit organizations. This subproject implements XML-based configuration and report generation capabilities, providing standardized reporting templates that can be customized for different conference types. The component transforms raw attendance data into actionable insights for organization administrators.

## Key Technical Capabilities

- XML-driven configuration system for report parameters and formatting
- Standardized report generation with configurable filtering options
- Conference selection and attendee filtering mechanisms
- Partner information integration and relationship mapping
- Configurable column display with maximum column constraints
- Parameter-based report customization for different use cases

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Framework**: Uses standard.xml to define report parameters, paths, and default values
2. **Parameter Management**: Implements a structured approach to managing conference keys, partner keys, and selection modes
3. **Integration with Partner System**: Connects with OpenPetra's core partner management to incorporate relationship data
4. **Flexible Report Generation**: Supports various filtering options and display configurations
5. **Infrastructure Layer Integration**: Operates within the Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports architecture layer

## Architecture Overview

The subproject follows a configuration-driven design pattern where report generation is controlled through XML configuration files. This approach separates report definition from implementation logic, allowing for customization without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the foundation for report generation, defining default parameters that can be overridden at runtime. The architecture integrates with OpenPetra's broader partner management and conference systems while maintaining a focused responsibility for attendance reporting.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for Conference Attendance Summary Report with default parameter settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines default parameters for the Conference Attendance Summary Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, report name, and various parameters related to conference selection, attendee filtering, and partner information. The file establishes initial values for conference and partner keys, maximum display columns, and selection modes for conferences and attendees. These parameters serve as the standard configuration when generating attendance summary reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'attendancesummaryreport.xml' that contains the actual report definition
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter set to 0, which likely means unlimited columns or system-determined layout
- `Line 7-8`: Default selection parameters indicate the report can filter by specific conferences or attendee groups
