# XML Partner by Field Report Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive administrative platform for non-profit organizations that handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship functions. The XML Partner by Field Report sub-project implements a specialized reporting mechanism that allows organizations to filter and extract partner data based on geographical and organizational parameters. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner data extraction based on geographical boundaries
- Filtering of partner records by multiple organizational criteria
- Parameter-driven report generation for personnel management
- Support for both sending and receiving field filtering

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The report structure uses XML configuration files to define default parameters and filtering options
2. Hierarchical Parameter Organization: Parameters are organized in a structured format with system settings, field selections, and filtering criteria
3. Boolean Flag System: Uses boolean parameters to toggle inclusion/exclusion of specific partner types
4. Geographical Filtering Framework: Implements multi-level geographical filtering (country, region, city, postcode)

## Overview
The architecture follows a parameter-driven approach where report behavior is controlled through 16 configurable parameters defined in standard.xml. This design enables flexible reporting without code changes. The implementation supports various filtering mechanisms including geographical boundaries, partner types, address validity checks, and commitment types. The report integrates with OpenPetra's Personnel module to provide targeted data extraction capabilities while maintaining consistent data representation across the system.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining default parameters for the Partner by Field report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameters for the Partner by Field report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It contains 16 parameters that control report filtering and behavior, including system settings, field selection, date parameters, address filtering options, and partner type filters. Key parameters include field selection, sending/receiving field options, commitment types, geographical filters (city, postcode, region, country), and boolean flags for address validity, active status, mailing addresses, families only, and solicitation exclusions.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Parameter 'param_fields' controls which fields are included in the report with an empty default value
- `Line 6`: Parameter 'param_sending_receiving' defaults to 'ReceivingField' indicating the report focuses on receiving field partners
- `Line 7`: Parameter 'param_commitments_and_worker_field' defaults to 'CommitmentsOnly' filtering the report scope
