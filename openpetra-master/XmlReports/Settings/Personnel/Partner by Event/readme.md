# XML Partner by Event Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source program that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks and reduce operational costs. The program provides comprehensive contact management and financial accounting capabilities. This sub-project implements XML-based reporting functionality for generating partner information filtered by event participation along with configurable parameter settings for report customization. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable report generation for partners based on event participation
- Flexible filtering options through standardized parameter definitions
- Status-based participant filtering (cancelled, rejected, accepted, hold, enquiry)
- Partner attribute filtering (active status, mailing addresses, family grouping)

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The standard.xml file defines default parameter settings that control report behavior and filtering options
2. Module Integration: The report is integrated with OpenPetra's Personnel module, providing specialized reporting capabilities
3. Boolean Parameter System: Leverages boolean flags to enable/disable specific filtering criteria
4. Hierarchical Parameter Organization: Parameters are structured in logical groups (system settings, event selection, status filters)

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration-driven reporting through XML definitions, allowing for flexible report generation without code changes. The parameter system provides comprehensive filtering capabilities for event participation data, enabling users to generate precisely targeted reports. The standard.xml configuration file serves as the foundation for report customization, with clear separation between report logic and filtering criteria. This design supports maintainability and extensibility while providing consistent reporting capabilities across the OpenPetra platform.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining default parameters for the 'Partner by Event' report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameter settings for the 'Partner by Event' report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It contains boolean and string parameters that control report filtering behavior, including event selection, participant status options (cancelled, rejected, accepted, hold, enquiry), and partner filtering options. Key parameters include system settings, event selection, status filters, and options to filter by active partners, mailing addresses, families only, and whether to exclude partners with no solicitation preferences.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: The 'param_events' parameter with empty value suggests this is a configurable field where users would specify event IDs or names
- `Line 5-9`: The five status parameters (cancelled, rejected, accepted, hold, enquiry) allow granular filtering of event participants by their registration status
- `Line 12`: The 'param_exclude_no_solicitations' parameter indicates integration with partner communication preferences
