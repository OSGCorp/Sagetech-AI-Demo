# XML Emergency Contact Staff Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage administrative tasks and reduce operational overhead. The XML Emergency Contact Staff Report subproject implements a specialized reporting capability within the Personnel module, providing structured access to critical emergency contact information for staff members. This subproject leverages XML configuration to define report structure, formatting, and display parameters.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-driven report configuration for consistent emergency contact data presentation
- Structured column definitions with precise width specifications for optimal layout
- Integration with OpenPetra's Personnel module data sources
- Standardized formatting of contact information including:
  - Contact relationship types and identifiers
  - Personal details and addressing information
  - Multiple communication channels (phone, mobile, email)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Architecture**: Uses XML to separate report structure from application logic
2. **Parameterized Column Definitions**: Enables consistent report formatting with 11 predefined data columns
3. **Module Integration**: Connects to the broader Personnel module within the OpenPetra ecosystem
4. **Standardized Data Presentation**: Ensures emergency contact information is displayed in a consistent, readable format

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach, where the standard.xml file serves as the template defining how emergency contact data is structured, formatted and presented. This design promotes maintainability by separating presentation logic from data retrieval, allowing for modifications to report layout without changing application code. The subproject addresses the critical need for quick access to emergency contact information in a clear, standardized format.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Emergency Contact Staff report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Emergency Contact Staff report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, report title, and column configurations. The file establishes 11 display columns including Emergency Contact Type, Key, Name, address details (Street, Post Code, City, Country), contact information (Primary Phone, Alternate Telephone, Mobile), and Primary E-Mail. Each column has an assigned width parameter to control the report layout. The file serves as a template that determines how emergency contact information for staff members is formatted and displayed in reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses eBoolean type parameter for system settings configuration
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files through comma-separated list for report generation
- `Line 7`: Defines maximum number of display columns as a configuration parameter
- `Line 10`: Uses partner key parameter initialized to zero, likely for filtering report data
- `Line 12`: Uses scientific notation (eDecimal:4612136378390124954) for column width specification
