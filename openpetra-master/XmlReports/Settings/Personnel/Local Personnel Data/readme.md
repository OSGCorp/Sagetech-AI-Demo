# XML Local Personnel Data Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Local Personnel Data Report is a configuration-driven component that enables OpenPetra to generate standardized personnel reports from partner data. This subproject implements a structured reporting framework for extracting, formatting, and presenting partner information across various organizational contexts. The configuration architecture uses declarative XML definitions to control report generation without requiring code changes.

## Key Technical Features

- **XML-Based Configuration System**: Defines report parameters, data sources, and display options through structured XML files
- **Flexible Partner Data Extraction**: Supports multiple partner categories (Person, Family, Organization)
- **Customizable Display Formatting**:
  - Configurable column definitions with width specifications
  - Sortable output with multi-level ordering capabilities
  - Label type specifications for different data contexts

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Definition**: Uses XML configuration rather than code to define report structure and behavior
2. **Multi-Category Partner Support**: Handles different partner types through a unified reporting interface
3. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Implements primary and secondary sorting mechanisms for organized data presentation
4. **Display Customization**: Provides granular control over visual presentation through column width specifications and label types

## Architecture Overview

The subproject follows a configuration-as-code approach, where report definitions in XML format drive the report generation process. This design separates the reporting logic from the presentation layer, allowing for flexible report customization without modifying application code. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both data sources and presentation rules for personnel reporting.

## Business Functions

### XML Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the 'Local Partner Data' personnel report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file configures the 'Local Partner Data' personnel report settings. It defines system parameters, XML data sources, display options, and sorting preferences. The file specifies that the report shows partner information with two display columns showing Partner Key and Partner Name, sorted primarily by Partner Name and secondarily by Partner Key. It also includes settings for column widths and label types for personnel data, supporting various partner categories like Person, Family, and Organization.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Enables system settings integration with eBoolean:true parameter
- `Line 4`: References external XML data source file for partner data
- `Line 15-16`: Defines human-readable sort order and corresponding column references
- `Line 17-20`: Configures column definitions with width specifications
- `Line 22`: Specifies supported partner types for label generation
