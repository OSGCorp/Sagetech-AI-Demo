# XML Emergency Contact Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Emergency Contact Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's Personnel module that generates structured emergency contact information for individuals in the system. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that extracts personnel data and their associated emergency contacts from XML data sources, formats it according to predefined specifications, and renders it in a standardized layout. The implementation provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable data source integration with personnel and emergency contact XML repositories
- Parameterized filtering by event, conference, unit, and application status
- Standardized column layout with customizable widths for emergency contact information
- Comprehensive contact data presentation including contact type, personal details, address information, and multiple communication channels

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The reporting framework uses XML configuration files to define data sources, column layouts, and filtering parameters without requiring code changes
2. Modular Data Source Integration: The architecture separates data source definitions from presentation logic, allowing for flexible data retrieval
3. Parameterized Filtering System: Implements a robust filtering mechanism that enables users to narrow report results based on multiple organizational criteria
4. Standardized Column Layout: Provides consistent presentation of emergency contact information with predefined column specifications and width controls

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, allowing report customization without code modifications. The XML configuration structure clearly separates data sources, filtering parameters, and presentation specifications, promoting maintainability. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader Personnel module while maintaining a focused purpose of providing critical emergency contact information in a standardized format. This design supports OpenPetra's mission to help non-profit organizations efficiently manage administrative tasks with minimal technical overhead.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Emergency Contact Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Emergency Contact Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It configures system settings, XML data sources, and report display properties. The file specifies data sources including personnel and emergency contact XML files, and defines report columns with their widths. Columns include Emergency Contact Type, Key, Name, address details (Street, Post Code, City, Country), and contact information (Primary Phone, Mobile, Alternate Telephone, Fax, Primary E-Mail). The file also contains parameters for filtering by event, conference, unit, and application status.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables access to global configuration
- `Line 4`: References external XML data sources that provide the report content
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 12 columns
- `Line 7-21`: Parameters for filtering report data by event, conference, unit and application status
