# XML Partner by Commitment Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner by Commitment Report is a configuration component within OpenPetra that defines parameters for generating specialized partner reports based on commitment criteria. This sub-project implements report configuration settings through XML-based parameter definitions, providing standardized reporting capabilities to the OpenPetra non-profit management system.

This configuration component provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Parameterized report generation for partner commitments
- Boolean parameter controls for filtering report content
- Standardized configuration settings for Personnel module reporting
- Customizable report behavior through parameter manipulation

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses structured XML to define report parameters, enabling consistent report generation across the system
2. Boolean Parameter System: Implements a series of boolean flags to control report behavior and filtering options
3. Personnel Module Integration: Designed specifically to work within OpenPetra's Personnel module reporting framework
4. Default Configuration Management: Establishes standard settings that serve as the baseline for report generation

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined through XML parameter settings rather than code. This design promotes separation of concerns by isolating report configuration from the application logic. The boolean parameter system provides flexibility while maintaining simplicity, allowing users to customize reports without requiring code changes. The standard configuration serves as both documentation and default implementation, ensuring consistent report behavior across the application.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Partner by Commitment report with default parameter settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameter settings for the Partner by Commitment report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It establishes boolean parameters that control report behavior, including system settings activation, active status filtering, restriction to mailing addresses, exclusion of partners with no solicitations, and an option to include all partners. These parameters serve as the standard configuration that will be applied when generating this specific report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5-10`: Multiple boolean parameters control filtering behavior for the report, with most defaulting to 'true' to include data
