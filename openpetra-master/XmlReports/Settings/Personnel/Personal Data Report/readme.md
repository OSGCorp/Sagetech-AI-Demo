# XML Personal Data Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Personal Data Report is a configuration-driven component within OpenPetra that generates comprehensive personnel reports from partner data. This subproject implements a structured XML-based reporting framework that transforms partner data into standardized personnel reports with configurable sections and formatting. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable report content selection through boolean flags
- Structured data presentation across multiple personnel domains
- Consistent formatting of complex personnel information
- Parameterized report generation for different organizational needs

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Section-Based Configuration**: The architecture allows administrators to selectively include or exclude specific personnel data sections (job assignments, commitments, passports, etc.) through boolean flags
2. **XML-Driven Structure**: Report definitions are maintained in XML configuration files that specify data sources, display columns, and formatting parameters
3. **Layered Data Organization**: Personnel data is organized into logical sections that can be independently configured and rendered
4. **Infrastructure Integration**: The component operates within OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer, connecting report definitions to the application's data sources

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configurability through XML-based definitions, allowing organizations to tailor personnel reports to their specific needs without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining which personnel data sections appear in reports and how they're formatted. This approach supports OpenPetra's mission of helping non-profits efficiently manage administrative tasks by providing flexible, comprehensive reporting capabilities for personnel management.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Personal Data Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Personnel Personal Data Report in OpenPetra. It configures which data sections to include in the report (local partner data, job assignments, commitments, passports, personal documents, special needs, budgets, skills, languages, and previous experiences) and their display settings. The file specifies XML source files, report identification, display column configuration, and boolean flags that control which sections of personal data appear in the generated report. These parameters determine both the content and formatting of the personnel report when generated by the system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Root Parameters element contains all configuration settings for the report
- `Line 3`: References external XML files that contain the actual report structure and common personnel elements
- `Line 7`: Partner selection parameters control whether the report shows one partner or multiple partners from an extract
- `Line 9-19`: Boolean flags control which sections of personal data appear in the final report
- `Line 23`: Column positioning and width parameters control the report layout
