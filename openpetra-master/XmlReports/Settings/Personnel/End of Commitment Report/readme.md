# XML End of Commitment Report Of Petra

The Petra system is a free, open-source administration platform designed for non-profit organizations to manage their operational needs efficiently. The XML End of Commitment Report subproject implements a specialized reporting component within the Personnel module that tracks and displays commitment-related data. This report provides critical visibility into partner commitments, their durations, and associated metadata.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration architecture for flexible report definition
- Parameterized report generation with multiple sorting options (End Date, Partner Name, Partner Key)
- Structured data column specifications with precise width controls for consistent layout
- Integration with OpenPetra's broader Personnel management framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: The report structure is defined through XML configuration rather than hardcoded logic, allowing for easier modifications
2. **Flexible Data Presentation**: Supports multiple sorting criteria to accommodate different analytical needs
3. **Standardized Column Definitions**: Seven core data columns with predefined widths ensure consistent report formatting
4. **Integration with Partner Data**: Leverages OpenPetra's partner management system to correlate commitment data with organizational entities

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports pattern, using XML-based configuration to define report parameters, data sources, and presentation rules. This approach separates the report definition from the rendering logic, enabling easier maintenance and extension of reporting capabilities without modifying core application code.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration for End of Commitment Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the configuration settings for the End of Commitment Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies system parameters including XML data sources, report title, and display constraints. The file configures report selection criteria, sorting options (by End Date, Partner Name, and Partner Key), and defines seven data columns to display: Partner Name, Partner Key, End Date, Start Date, Field Name, Commitment Type, and Partner Type. Each column is assigned a specific width value to control the report layout.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data files that provide the actual report data
- `Line 8`: Defines partner selection mode as 'one partner' which affects filtering behavior
- `Line 13-15`: Establishes a three-level sorting hierarchy for report data organization
- `Line 17-18`: Uses readable and column-indexed sorting parameters for flexibility in report generation
