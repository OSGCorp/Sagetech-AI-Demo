# XML Length Of Commitment Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Length Of Commitment Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra non-profit management system. This subproject implements a configurable personnel reporting mechanism that tracks and analyzes commitment durations for organization members or partners. The report is defined through XML configuration, allowing for flexible customization while maintaining consistent output formats.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized personnel commitment tracking with configurable display options
- Multi-dimensional sorting capabilities (by anniversary date, commitment length, and partner name)
- Structured data presentation with predefined column layouts and widths
- Year-to-date calculation parameters for accurate reporting periods

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, parameters, and display options without requiring code changes
2. **Flexible Sorting Mechanism**: Implements multi-level sorting preferences to organize personnel data according to organizational needs
3. **Standardized Column Definitions**: Maintains consistent data presentation through predefined column specifications for partner information and commitment metrics
4. **Calculation Parameters**: Incorporates specialized calculation logic for determining commitment lengths and anniversary dates
5. **Integration with OpenPetra Data Sources**: Connects to the broader system's data infrastructure to retrieve and process personnel information

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior and appearance are externalized in XML files. This design promotes maintainability by separating report definitions from application code, enabling non-technical users to modify reports. The standardized structure ensures consistent data presentation while the calculation parameters provide accurate metrics for organizational planning and personnel management.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for Length of Commitment personnel report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Length of Commitment personnel report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, display options, and column configurations. The file establishes sort order preferences (by Date of Anniversary, Length of Commitment, and Partner Surname), defines five display columns (Partner Surname, Partner Firstname, Date of Anniversary, Length of Commitment, and Country of Service), and sets column widths. It also includes parameters for calculations and year-to-date settings for each column, creating a standardized report layout for tracking personnel commitment lengths.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables core functionality for the report
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide data sources for the report
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 5, affecting report layout and data presentation
- `Line 10-12`: Establishes a three-level sort hierarchy for organizing personnel records
- `Line 22-30`: Column width values use unusual decimal notation (4611686018427387904) suggesting binary representation
