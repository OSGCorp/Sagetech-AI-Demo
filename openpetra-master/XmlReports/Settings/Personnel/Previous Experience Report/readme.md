# XML Previous Experience Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Previous Experience Report is a configuration-driven component within OpenPetra that generates structured reports of personnel experience data. This sub-project implements a standardized reporting framework for displaying historical experience records in a consistent, sortable format. The report configuration provides flexible data presentation capabilities to the OpenPetra personnel management system.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration for report definition and styling
- Configurable sorting options (Partner Name, Partner Key, Start Date)
- Structured column layout with defined widths and display parameters
- Dynamic column stretching to optimize display area utilization
- Integration with Personnel module data sources

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure, separating presentation logic from application code
2. **Flexible Data Sorting**: Implements multiple sort options to allow different views of the same dataset
3. **Standardized Column Definitions**: Provides consistent display of partner information including names, keys, dates, and role details
4. **Display Optimization**: Incorporates column stretching to maximize readability across different screen sizes
5. **Personnel Data Integration**: Connects directly to OpenPetra's partner and personnel data sources

## Architecture
The report operates within OpenPetra's configuration-driven reporting framework, leveraging XML definitions to generate consistent reports without requiring code changes. This approach enables non-technical administrators to modify report layouts while maintaining system integrity and consistent styling across the application.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the Previous Experience Report in the Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file configures the Previous Experience Report for the Personnel module in OpenPetra. It defines system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display parameters. The file specifies sorting options by Partner Name, Partner Key, and Start Date, along with column definitions for displaying partner information including name, key, experience type, dates, location, organization, and role. Each column has a defined width, and the report is configured to stretch columns to fit the display area.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data files that provide the actual report data
- `Line 6`: Sets maximum display columns to 8, limiting the report's horizontal display capacity
- `Line 11-13`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for organizing report data
- `Line 15-29`: Defines 8 columns with specific widths to display partner experience information
