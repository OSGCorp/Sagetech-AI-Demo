# XML Job Assignment Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Job Assignment Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra's Personnel module that generates structured job assignment data for non-profit organizations. The subproject implements a declarative XML-based report definition system that controls data retrieval, presentation formatting, and output generation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable personnel reporting with customizable sorting criteria
- Structured data presentation with defined column specifications
- Flexible filtering options for targeted staff selection
- Standardized output formatting for consistent report generation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report parameters, data sources, and display options without requiring code changes
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Implements sorting criteria (Partner Name, Start Date, Role Key) to structure personnel information logically
3. **Flexible Column Management**: Defines eight standard columns with specified widths and calculation parameters for consistent data presentation
4. **Filtering Framework**: Provides mechanisms to filter staff records based on organizational requirements

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, allowing report customization without modifying application logic. The XML structure serves as both documentation and implementation, defining how the Personnel module retrieves and presents job assignment data. The report definition integrates with OpenPetra's broader data management capabilities while maintaining a focused purpose of tracking personnel roles, assignments, and relationships within the organization. This design supports OpenPetra's mission of helping non-profits efficiently manage administrative tasks with minimal technical overhead.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Job Assignment Report in the Personnel module of OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the parameters for the Job Assignment Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It configures system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display options. The file specifies sorting criteria (Partner Name, Start Date, Role Key) and defines eight display columns including Partner Key, Partner Name, Start Date, End Date, Field Name, Role Key, Role Name, and Assistant. Each column has specified widths and calculation parameters. The configuration supports filtering options for staff selection and controls how data is presented in the report output.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the actual data for the report
- `Line 8`: Defines a maximum of 8 display columns for the report layout
- `Line 12-14`: Establishes a three-level sorting hierarchy for organizing report data
- `Line 15-17`: Maps sort parameters to specific column numbers for data processing
