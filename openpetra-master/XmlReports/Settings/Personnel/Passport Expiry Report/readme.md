# XML Passport Expiry Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage administrative tasks and reduce operational overhead. This sub-project implements a specialized reporting capability focused on passport expiration tracking within the Personnel module. The implementation provides a structured approach to monitoring critical document expiration dates for organization members, staff, or partners.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration framework for flexible report definition
- Structured data extraction from the Personnel module's partner records
- Parameterized sorting capabilities (expiry date, partner name, partner key)
- Customizable column layout with width specifications
- Integrated partner selection and filtering mechanisms

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Architecture**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Organizes partner data with multiple sort levels for intuitive report presentation
3. **Modular Column Definition**: Each report column is independently defined with specific width parameters
4. **Integrated Partner Selection**: Built-in filtering capabilities to target specific partner subsets
5. **Personnel Module Integration**: Seamlessly connects with OpenPetra's core partner management functionality

## Technical Implementation

The implementation centers around the `standard.xml` configuration file which defines the report structure, data sources, and presentation parameters. This approach separates the report definition from the rendering logic, enabling easier maintenance and customization while maintaining consistent data extraction and presentation across the application.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Passport Expiry Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Passport Expiry Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display configuration. The file establishes sorting order by passport expiry date, partner name, and partner key, and defines six report columns: Partner Name, Partner Key, Passport Expiry Date, Passport Type, Field, and Partner Type. Each column has an assigned width value to control the report layout. The configuration also includes parameters for partner selection and extraction criteria.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data sources that provide the actual report data
- `Line 9`: Configures partner selection mode as 'one partner' which affects filtering behavior
- `Line 11-13`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for report data presentation
- `Line 15`: Human-readable representation of sort columns for UI display
