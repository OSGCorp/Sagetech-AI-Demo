# XML Unit Hierarchy Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Unit Hierarchy Report is a configuration-driven component within OpenPetra's Personnel module that generates structured organizational unit hierarchy representations. The subproject implements a declarative reporting framework that transforms organizational unit data into hierarchical reports through XML configuration. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Hierarchical visualization of organizational units with customizable display options
- Configurable column definitions for unit properties (UnitKey, UnitType, UnitName)
- Flexible filtering mechanisms for unit code selection and hierarchy depth
- XML-based parameter configuration for consistent report generation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Driven Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, columns, and display parameters without requiring code changes
2. **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Implements specialized algorithms to transform flat unit data into properly indented hierarchical structures
3. **Flexible Filtering System**: Provides parameter-based filtering to include or exclude specific organizational units based on codes and types
4. **Columnar Output Configuration**: Supports customizable column widths, visibility, and content formatting for different reporting needs

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, allowing non-technical users to modify report behavior through XML settings. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining data sources, display parameters, and column specifications. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader Personnel module while maintaining independence through its parameter-driven design. This approach enables easy maintenance and extension of reporting capabilities without modifying core application code.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Unit Hierarchy Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Unit Hierarchy Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report name, display options, and column configurations. The file sets up three columns for the report: UnitKey, UnitType, and UnitName, with their respective column widths. It also includes parameters for unit code filtering and inclusion options that control how the organizational hierarchy is displayed in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data file for personnel unit hierarchy data
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 3 columns
- `Line 8`: Boolean parameter 'param_chkInclude' likely controls inclusion of sub-units in hierarchy
