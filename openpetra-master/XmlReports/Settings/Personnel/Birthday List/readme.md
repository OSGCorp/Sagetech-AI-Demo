# XML Birthday List Report Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a comprehensive management system for non-profit organizations, handling administration, accounting, and contact management. The XML Birthday List Report subproject implements a specialized reporting capability that generates formatted birthday lists for personnel management. This component leverages XML configuration to define report structure, data sources, and presentation parameters.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Configurable personnel birthday reporting with customizable display columns
- Flexible sorting options (by birth date and partner name)
- Comprehensive filtering mechanisms for staff selection and partner types
- Anniversary tracking and reporting functionality
- Country of service integration for international organizations

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, parameters, and display options without requiring code changes
2. Standardized Column Definitions: Implements seven predefined columns with specific widths and calculation methods
3. Flexible Data Filtering: Supports complex filtering options for staff selection, anniversaries, and partner types
4. Integration with Partner Management: Connects with the core partner database to extract relevant personnel information
5. Internationalization Support: Includes country of service tracking for global organizations

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design promotes maintainability by separating report specifications from application code. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining data sources, display parameters, and calculation methods. This approach allows for easy customization of reports without modifying application code, supporting the broader Petra goal of reducing administrative overhead for non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for a Birthday List report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Personnel Birthday List report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display configuration. The file configures sorting by birth date and partner name, and defines seven display columns including Partner Name, Gender, Partner Key, Date of Birth, Start/End Date of Commitment, and Country of Service. Additional parameters control filtering options for staff selection, anniversaries, and partner types. Each column has defined widths and calculation methods to properly format and display personnel birthday information.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Enables system settings integration for the report
- `Line 4`: References external XML data files that provide the source data
- `Line 9`: Defines staff selection parameter with 'all current staff' as default
- `Line 12-14`: Configures sorting logic using calculated fields for date of birth and partner information
- `Line 15-19`: Provides configuration options for anniversaries and partner type filtering
