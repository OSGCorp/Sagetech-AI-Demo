# XML Outreach Options Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that provides administrative tools for non-profit organizations. The XML Outreach Options Report subproject implements a specialized reporting module that generates personnel outreach information in structured formats. This subproject focuses on configuration-driven report generation with standardized layouts and sorting capabilities. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- XML-based report configuration and parameter definition
- Structured data presentation with configurable column layouts
- Flexible sorting mechanisms for outreach data (by code, unit name, or date)
- Standardized display of personnel outreach information

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Framework**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, data sources, and display properties without requiring code changes
2. **Column-Based Layout System**: Supports up to 6 display columns with configurable widths for consistent report formatting
3. **Multi-level Sorting Options**: Implements hierarchical sorting by Outreach Code, Unit Name, and Start Date
4. **Data Field Mapping**: Maps database fields to display columns for Unit Key, Unit Name, Unit Code, Outreach Code, and date fields

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, allowing report customization through XML definitions rather than code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both the data sources and presentation layer. This design enables non-technical users to modify report layouts while maintaining consistent formatting across the application. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader reporting infrastructure while providing specialized functionality for personnel outreach tracking and analysis.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration for Personnel Outreach Options report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Personnel Outreach Options report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, and report display properties including a maximum of 6 display columns. The file configures sorting options by Outreach Code, Unit Name, and Start Date, and defines column calculations and widths for displaying Unit Key, Unit Name, Unit Code, Outreach Code, Start Date, and End Date. Each column has an assigned width value to control the report layout.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables access to global configuration
- `Line 4`: References external XML data source file for outreach options data
- `Line 9-13`: Defines three-level sorting hierarchy for report organization
- `Line 15-26`: Column definitions with width specifications control report layout
