# XML Partner by Outreach Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. This sub-project implements XML-based configuration for generating partner reports related to outreach events, providing filtering capabilities based on event participation status. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner filtering based on event participation status
- Boolean flag-based selection criteria for report generation
- Integration with the Personnel module's event management system
- Support for complex filtering combinations across multiple parameters

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses structured XML to define report parameters and filtering options, enabling consistent report generation
2. **Boolean Flag System**: Implements a series of boolean flags to control inclusion/exclusion of partners based on specific criteria
3. **Event Role Filtering**: Provides granular control over which event participation statuses (cancelled, rejected, accepted, hold, enquiry) should be included in reports
4. **Additional Filtering Criteria**: Supports supplementary filtering based on active status, mailing address availability, family-only filtering, and solicitation preferences

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, allowing report parameters to be defined externally in XML rather than hardcoded in the application. This enables flexible report customization without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the foundation for the "Partner by Event Role" report, defining the default parameter settings that control which partners appear in generated reports. This design facilitates maintenance and extension of reporting capabilities while maintaining separation between the reporting logic and filtering criteria.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining default parameters for the 'Partner by Event Role' report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file contains default parameter settings for the 'Partner by Event Role' report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It defines boolean flags for filtering partners based on their event participation status (cancelled, rejected, accepted, hold, enquiry) and other criteria like active status, mailing address availability, family-only filtering, and solicitation preferences. These parameters control which partners appear in the report output based on their relationship to outreach events.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Defines the report name as 'Partner by Event Role' which indicates this is specifically for event participation reporting
- `Line 5`: Empty string parameter for 'param_events' suggests this can be populated with specific event IDs at runtime
- `Line 12`: The 'param_exclude_no_solicitations' parameter allows filtering out partners who have requested not to be solicited
