# XML Emergency Data Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Emergency Data Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's Personnel module that generates structured emergency information documents for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that extracts critical personnel data and formats it for emergency response scenarios. The implementation leverages XML configuration to define report parameters, content selection, and formatting rules without requiring code changes.

## Key Technical Capabilities

- Configurable partner selection criteria for targeted report generation
- Structured data extraction from multiple personnel-related domains (contacts, documents, skills)
- Flexible display options for family members, addresses, and personal documentation
- Parameterized layout control including column positioning and width calculations
- Conditional content inclusion based on configuration parameters

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Driven Configuration**: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, content, and formatting without code modifications
2. **Modular Content Sections**: Organizes emergency data into logical sections (personal documents, special needs, emergency contacts) that can be independently configured
3. **Parameter-Based Customization**: Supports extensive parameterization for controlling what information appears and how it's formatted
4. **Integration with Personnel Module**: Leverages OpenPetra's core personnel data structures while providing specialized emergency reporting capabilities

## Architecture Overview
The subproject follows a configuration-driven architecture where the standard.xml file serves as the central definition point for report generation. This approach separates reporting logic from presentation concerns, enabling non-technical users to modify report content and format through configuration changes rather than code modifications.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Emergency Data Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Emergency Data Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies required XML files, report settings, and display options. The file contains parameters for selecting partners, display options for family members, addresses, passports, personal documents, emergency data, special needs, skills, languages, emergency contacts, and proof questions. It also configures column positioning, width, and calculation values. These parameters control what information appears in the report and how it's formatted when generated.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report definition structure
- `Line 7`: Limits display columns to 1, affecting report layout
- `Line 9-10`: Partner selection parameters allow targeting specific individuals
- `Line 11-19`: Configurable content sections with boolean flags for including/excluding information categories
- `Line 20`: Page break control parameter for multi-partner reports
