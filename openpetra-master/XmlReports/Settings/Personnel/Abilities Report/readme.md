# XML Abilities Report Subproject Of Petra

The XML Abilities Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra ecosystem that generates structured personnel abilities data for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements a configurable XML-based reporting framework that transforms personnel data into actionable insights through standardized report templates. The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach where report parameters, data sources, and presentation formats are defined in XML configuration files.

## Key Technical Capabilities

- XML-driven report configuration for flexible report definition without code changes
- Event-based filtering system for targeted personnel data extraction
- Structured column-based output formatting with configurable widths
- Multi-status application filtering (accepted, cancelled, enquiry, hold, rejected)
- Partner and event code correlation for comprehensive personnel tracking

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Uses XML schemas to define report structure, allowing for rapid report modification without application recompilation
2. **Hierarchical Data Filtering**: Implements nested filtering criteria for precise data selection based on events, partner information, and application status
3. **Standardized Output Formatting**: Enforces consistent column structures with predefined widths for reliable report rendering
4. **Integration with Partner Management**: Leverages OpenPetra's core partner management system for data sourcing and relationship mapping

The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, enabling administrators to modify report behavior through XML files rather than requiring developer intervention. This approach aligns with OpenPetra's broader mission of reducing administrative overhead for non-profit organizations while maintaining robust data management capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Personnel Abilities Report defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Personnel Abilities Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, and report configuration options. The file establishes event-based filtering parameters including event selection, codes, conference details, and application status filters (accepted, cancelled, enquiry, hold, rejected). It also defines the report's column structure with six columns: Event Code, Partner Key, Partner Name, Application Status, Experience, and Level, each with specified widths. These parameters control how personnel abilities data is filtered and displayed in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML data sources that are combined for the report generation
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the visible columns in the report interface
- `Line 7-11`: Event-based filtering parameters allow contextual data selection
- `Line 12-16`: Boolean flags for application status filtering provide granular control over displayed records
- `Line 17-28`: Column definition system with calculation parameters and width specifications
