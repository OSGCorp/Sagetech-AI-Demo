# XML Languages Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks. The XML Languages Report subproject implements a specialized reporting capability for personnel language proficiency tracking and assessment. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized language proficiency reporting for personnel
- Configurable display parameters for report generation
- Flexible data sorting and filtering by language attributes
- Partner-centric language skill assessment

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Configurable Column Layout**: The report template supports up to 8 display columns with customizable widths and content
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Partner information is linked to language proficiency data in a structured format
3. **Flexible Sorting Mechanisms**: Reports can be sorted by Language, Translation capability, and Experience level
4. **Parameterized Data Sources**: The configuration allows for dynamic data source selection based on events and application statuses

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative XML-based configuration approach, allowing for consistent report generation without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the template definition, establishing the report structure, data sources, and presentation parameters. The design separates the report definition from the underlying data, enabling administrators to modify report behavior through configuration rather than code changes. This approach supports the broader OpenPetra goal of reducing administrative overhead while maintaining flexibility for different organizational needs.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for a Personnel Languages Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for a Personnel Languages Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML source files, and report display options including a maximum of 8 display columns. The file configures data source parameters related to events, application statuses, and sorting preferences by Language, Translate, and Experience. It defines five report columns with their calculations and widths: Partner Key, Partner Name, Language, Experience, and Level. This configuration serves as a template for generating standardized language proficiency reports for personnel in the organization.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables global configuration access
- `Line 7`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 8 columns maximum
- `Line 19-21`: Three-level sorting hierarchy defined for report organization
- `Line 23`: Human-readable sort description stored separately from column indices
