# XML Progress Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Progress Report is a configuration-driven component that handles personnel progress reporting within the OpenPetra system. This subproject implements structured data representation and reporting capabilities through XML-based configuration files. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- XML-based report definition and configuration
- Standardized personnel progress tracking
- Configurable column layouts and data presentation
- Flexible sorting mechanisms for report data

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Structure**: The standard.xml file defines all report parameters, enabling separation of report logic from application code
2. **Columnar Data Organization**: The system organizes personnel data into well-defined columns (Partner Name, Partner Key, Report Date, etc.) with precise width specifications
3. **Sorting Framework**: Configurable multi-level sorting preferences allow customized data presentation
4. **Data Source Integration**: XML data sources are explicitly defined, enabling the report to pull from various system components

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined through XML rather than code. This provides flexibility for report customization without requiring code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both data selection criteria and visual presentation parameters. This design supports OpenPetra's non-profit focus by making personnel progress reporting accessible and configurable, while maintaining a consistent structure that integrates with the broader system's data management capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Personnel Progress Report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Personnel Progress Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display configuration. The file sets up column definitions including Partner Name, Partner Key, Report Date, Report Type, Reporter, Next Report Date, and Report Comment, with corresponding column widths. It also configures sorting preferences, with default ordering by Partner Name, Partner Key, and Report Date. The parameters control both the data selection and visual presentation of the personnel progress reporting functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual report data structure and personnel information
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 7 columns for layout control
- `Line 11-13`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for report data organization
- `Line 15-28`: Column definitions with width specifications control the report's visual layout
