# XML Personal Documents Expiry Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Personal Documents Expiry Report is a specialized configuration component within OpenPetra's Personnel module that enables tracking and reporting of document expiration dates. This subproject implements standardized XML-based report configuration along with parameter definitions for document expiry tracking. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured document expiry monitoring through predefined report templates
- Configurable column display for personnel document management
- Customizable sorting and filtering of expiration data
- Integration with OpenPetra's partner management system

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report structure, parameters, and display characteristics without requiring code changes
2. Standardized Column Definitions: Implements seven core data columns with predefined widths for consistent reporting
3. Multi-level Sorting Logic: Employs a three-tier sorting hierarchy (Expiry Date → Document Type → Partner Name) for intuitive data presentation
4. Partner-Document Association Framework: Links document records to partner entities through the OpenPetra partner key system

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's configuration-driven approach, separating report definitions from application logic. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both visual presentation and data extraction parameters. This design enables non-technical users to modify report behavior without code changes while maintaining consistent integration with OpenPetra's broader Personnel and Partner Management modules. The report structure balances comprehensive document tracking with clear presentation of critical expiration information.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for Personal Documents Expiry Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Personal Documents Expiry Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, column definitions, and sorting preferences. The file configures seven display columns including Partner Name, Partner Key, Document Type, Start Date, Expiry Date, Document ID, and Associated Document, with specified column widths. It also sets default sorting by Expiry Date, Document Type, and Partner Name, and includes parameters for partner selection and extraction options.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the actual data for the report
- `Line 9`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the number of columns shown in the report to 7
- `Line 13-15`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for organizing document records in the report
- `Line 17`: param_sortby_columns maps the sort fields to their respective column indices
