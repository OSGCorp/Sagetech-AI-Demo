# XML Start of Commitment Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Start of Commitment Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates personnel commitment reports for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements a standardized XML-based definition framework for commitment reporting along with the necessary parameter configurations to support flexible report generation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable date range filtering for commitment reporting
- Customizable sorting options (Start Date, End Date, Partner Name)
- Flexible column definition and width specifications
- Partner-centric data presentation with integrated contact information

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report parameters, enabling easy modification without code changes
2. Parameterized Date Ranges: Supports dynamic date filtering through configurable start/end date parameters
3. Flexible Sorting System: Implements multiple sort options to accommodate different organizational viewing preferences
4. Column-Based Data Presentation: Defines specific column layouts with precise width specifications for consistent reporting
5. Field Integration: Combines commitment data with partner details and contact information in a unified report format

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, using XML definitions to drive report generation. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining all aspects of the report from data sources to visual presentation. This design promotes maintainability by isolating report definitions from implementation code, allowing non-technical users to modify report parameters. The component integrates with OpenPetra's broader data management system to pull commitment information, partner details, and related fields into a cohesive reporting structure.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Start of Commitment Report in OpenPetra's Personnel module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines parameters for the Personnel Start of Commitment Report in OpenPetra. It configures system settings, XML data sources, date ranges, sorting options, and column definitions. The file specifies display parameters including column widths and calculation fields for report generation. Key parameters include start/end dates, sort order preferences (by Start Date, End Date, Partner Name), and column configurations for displaying commitment information such as Field Name, Commitment Type, Partner details, and contact information.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2-3`: Defines system settings and XML data source files that provide the underlying data structure for the report
- `Line 8-10`: Contains boolean parameters for status filtering that control which records appear in the report
- `Line 11-15`: Implements a multi-level sorting mechanism with both machine-readable and human-readable sort definitions
- `Line 16-33`: Defines a column structure with explicit width allocations for proper report formatting
