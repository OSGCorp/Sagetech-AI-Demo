# XML HOSA Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a .NET-based program that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and generates standardized reports for organizational oversight. This sub-project implements XML-based configuration for HOSA (Hierarchical Organization of Standard Accounts) financial reporting along with parameter-driven report generation capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized financial reporting through XML configuration
- Customizable report parameter definitions
- Currency handling and display options
- Period-based financial data presentation
- Cost center filtering and hierarchy management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Driven Configuration**: The system uses XML files to define report structure, parameters, and display options without requiring code changes
2. **Parameterized Reporting**: Reports can be customized through various parameters including account hierarchy type, currency settings, and period options
3. **Financial Data Presentation**: Specialized handling for financial data presentation including currency formatting and period-based grouping
4. **Hierarchical Account Structure**: Support for HOSA (Hierarchical Organization of Standard Accounts) to organize financial data in meaningful structures

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design separates the report configuration from the application code, allowing for greater flexibility in report customization without requiring code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point for the HOSA financial report, defining everything from system settings to display options. This approach enables non-technical users to modify report parameters while maintaining consistent financial reporting standards across the application.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for HOSA financial report settings in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the HOSA financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, required XML files, report identification, display options, and various report parameters. Key parameters include account hierarchy type, currency settings, period display options, and cost center filtering preferences. The file serves as a configuration template that controls how the HOSA financial report is generated and displayed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to create the complete report definition
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report's visual layout to 2 columns
- `Line 10-12`: Parameters control temporal display options with mutually exclusive settings for quarter vs period views
