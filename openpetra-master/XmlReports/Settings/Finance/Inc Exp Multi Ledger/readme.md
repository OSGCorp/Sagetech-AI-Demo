# XML Income Expense Multi Ledger Report Of Petra

The Petra application is a financial management system that helps non-profit organizations handle accounting and administrative tasks. The XML Income Expense Multi Ledger Report sub-project implements specialized financial reporting capabilities that allow organizations to compare and analyze income and expense data across multiple ledgers. This component provides these key technical capabilities to the Petra program:

- Multi-ledger financial data comparison with configurable display columns
- Variance and percentage variance calculations between actual values
- Customizable account hierarchy representation in reports
- Flexible currency handling and formatting options
- Cost center selection and filtering mechanisms

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The system uses XML files to define report parameters, making report definitions portable and easily modifiable without code changes
2. Columnar Data Architecture: The reporting engine supports multiple data columns with different calculation types (actual values, variances, percentages)
3. Hierarchical Account Representation: Reports can display financial data according to configurable account hierarchy settings
4. Currency Transformation: Built-in support for currency formatting and conversion between different currency types
5. Cost Center Integration: Reports can filter and aggregate data across organizational cost centers

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach through XML definition files that control report generation behavior. The standard.xml file serves as the foundation for report parameters, defining the structure and calculation logic for income and expense comparisons. The system supports year-to-date reporting options and provides flexible display preferences. This component integrates with Petra's broader financial management capabilities while providing specialized multi-ledger reporting functionality for financial analysis and decision-making.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Income Expense Statement report with multi-ledger comparison settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameters for the Income Expense Statement report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system. It configures a multi-ledger comparison report with four display columns showing actual values and variance calculations. Parameters include account hierarchy settings, currency options, cost center selections, calculation types for each column, and display preferences. The file specifies that columns 0 and 1 show 'Actual Selected Year' data, while columns 2 and 3 display 'Variance' and 'Variance %' calculations between the first two columns. Additional settings control year-to-date options, currency formatting, and cost center handling.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: References system settings with Boolean parameter that likely controls global configuration access
- `Line 4`: Defines XML dependency chain by referencing multiple finance-related XML files
- `Line 6`: Limits display to maximum of 4 columns for report presentation
- `Line 22-29`: Implements column-specific parameters using column attribute to configure different data views side-by-side
