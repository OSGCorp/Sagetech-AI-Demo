# XML Donor By Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Donor By Field Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's Finance module that generates donor information organized by specific fields. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that allows non-profit organizations to extract and analyze donor data according to customizable parameters. The report configuration is defined through structured XML, enabling flexible report generation while maintaining consistency across the OpenPetra platform.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Parameter-driven report generation for donor financial data
- Configurable filtering based on system settings and ledger selection
- Temporal analysis through receipt letter frequency and date range parameters
- Selective data inclusion based on donor status and address type

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses structured XML to define report parameters, ensuring consistency and maintainability
2. Parameterized Reporting: Implements eight distinct parameters that control report output and filtering
3. Module Integration: Seamlessly integrates with OpenPetra's Finance module and broader reporting infrastructure
4. Selective Data Retrieval: Provides granular control over which donor records appear in generated reports

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined through XML rather than code. This design promotes separation between report definition and implementation logic, allowing for easier maintenance and extension of reporting capabilities. The standard.xml file serves as the configuration blueprint, defining the parameter structure that the reporting engine uses to generate donor reports according to user-specified criteria.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Donor By Field financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the standard parameters for the Donor By Field report in OpenPetra's Finance module. It specifies eight parameters that control report generation, including system settings, ledger selection, receipt letter frequency, date range filters, active status filtering, and an option to include only mailing addresses. These parameters allow users to customize the financial donor report based on specific criteria when generating reports through the OpenPetra reporting system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Boolean parameter 'systemsettings' is set to true by default, indicating this report uses system-wide configuration settings
- `Line 5`: The 'param_all_ledgers' parameter allows toggling between specific ledger selection and using all available ledgers
