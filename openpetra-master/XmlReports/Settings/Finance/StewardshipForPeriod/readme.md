# XML Stewardship For Period Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Stewardship For Period Report is a specialized financial reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized financial stewardship reports for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements XML-based configuration and templating for period-based financial reporting, allowing organizations to track and analyze their financial stewardship across different time intervals (periods, quarters, or specific date ranges).

The subproject's architecture is built around XML configuration files that define report parameters, financial period settings, and currency configurations. These configurations drive the report generation process, ensuring consistent financial reporting across the OpenPetra platform.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration for financial reporting parameters
- Flexible period definition (standard periods, quarters, or custom date ranges)
- Multi-currency support with base currency specification
- Standardized financial year handling with configurable date ranges
- Parameter-driven report generation for consistent output

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Uses XML to define all report parameters, making report customization possible without code changes
2. **Financial Period Abstraction**: Supports multiple time-based reporting models through boolean flags that control period type selection
3. **Currency Normalization**: Implements base currency conversion for standardized financial reporting across international operations
4. **Year-Based Financial Boundaries**: Configures fiscal year parameters to ensure accurate period-based financial calculations
5. **Parameter Inheritance**: Allows report instances to inherit and override standard configurations for customized reporting needs

The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is determined by XML settings rather than hard-coded logic, enabling flexibility while maintaining consistency in financial reporting outputs.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the StewardshipForPeriod financial report with default parameter settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines default parameters for the StewardshipForPeriod financial report in OpenPetra. It sets system settings, report identification, period parameters (start/end periods, year), currency settings (Base/CHF), and date ranges for financial reporting. The file includes boolean flags for different reporting period options (period, date, quarter) and specifies the current financial year as 2015 with corresponding date ranges.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References common.xml which likely contains shared settings used across multiple reports
- `Line 7-8`: Period parameters suggest the report can be configured to show data across specific accounting periods
- `Line 9-10`: Currency parameters indicate support for different currency reporting options
- `Line 11-14`: Multiple period selection options (period, date, quarter) with mutual exclusivity through boolean flags
