# XML Field Leader Gift Summary 2 Report Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks including accounting, contact management, and sponsorship. The XML Field Leader Gift Summary 2 Report sub-project implements specialized financial reporting functionality that provides detailed gift summaries for field leaders. This component is configured through XML-based definitions that control report presentation and calculation logic within the finance module.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-driven report configuration for flexible financial data presentation
- Structured column definitions with seven distinct calculation types:
  - Detail, Credits, Debits
  - Motivation Detail and Motivation Group
  - Partner Key and Partner Name
- Currency formatting and transaction counting parameters
- Year-to-date calculation support for financial aggregation
- Credit/debit column indicators for clear financial representation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure and behavior without requiring code changes
2. **Modular Parameter System**: Separates system settings from display configuration
3. **Flexible Column Calculation**: Supports multiple calculation types for diverse financial reporting needs
4. **Standardized Financial Formatting**: Implements consistent currency presentation rules
5. **Integration with Finance Module**: Functions as a specialized component within OpenPetra's broader financial reporting framework

## Architecture
The report operates within OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer, leveraging the application's financial data model while providing specialized presentation logic for field leader gift summaries. The XML configuration approach enables non-technical administrators to modify report behavior without requiring software development skills.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for Field Leader Gift Summary report defining parameters, columns, and calculation settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Field Leader Gift Summary report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, related XML files, and report structure with seven display columns. Each column has defined calculation types (Detail, Credits, Debits, Motivation Detail, Motivation Group, Partner Key, Partner Name), widths, and year-to-date settings. The file also includes currency format settings, transaction counting parameters, and credit/debit column indicators. These parameters control how financial gift data is presented and calculated in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to create the complete report definition
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 7, controlling report layout
- `Line 7-33`: Defines a structured column system with different calculation types and widths for financial reporting
