# XML Donor By Miscellaneous Report Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive administrative platform designed for non-profit organizations that provides contact management, accounting, and data processing capabilities. The XML Donor By Miscellaneous Report sub-project implements a specialized reporting module within the finance subsystem that generates filtered donor reports based on configurable parameters.

This reporting component provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Parameterized donor filtering based on multiple boolean flags
- Configurable report generation for financial analysis
- Selective inclusion/exclusion of donor records based on status and attributes
- XML-based configuration for consistent report definition

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The module uses XML configuration files to define default parameter settings, enabling consistent report generation across the application
2. Boolean Parameter System: Implements four key boolean parameters (active status, mailing address filtering, family grouping, and solicitation preferences) that control report output
3. Finance Module Integration: Operates within OpenPetra's finance subsystem to provide donor-specific reporting capabilities
4. Extensible Parameter Framework: The standard.xml configuration provides a template that can be extended for additional filtering options

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined through XML parameter settings. This design promotes maintainability by centralizing report configuration and separating the reporting logic from parameter definition. The module focuses specifically on donor filtering and selection criteria, providing financial administrators with flexible reporting options while maintaining consistent output formats.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining default parameters for the Donor By Miscellaneous report in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameter settings for the Donor By Miscellaneous report in OpenPetra's finance module. It contains four boolean parameters that control report behavior: param_active (enabled by default), param_mailing_addresses_only (true), param_families_only (true), and param_exclude_no_solicitations (true). These settings determine which donors are included in the report and what data is displayed.
