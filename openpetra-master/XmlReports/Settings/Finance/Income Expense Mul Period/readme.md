# XML Income Expense Multiple Period Report Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a .NET-based application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles accounting operations and financial reporting across multiple currencies and organizational structures. This sub-project implements XML-based configuration and rendering of multi-period income and expense reports along with parameter management for financial data visualization. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Multi-period financial data comparison and analysis
- Configurable account hierarchy representation
- Flexible currency handling and conversion
- Customizable cost center reporting options
- Parameterized calculation methods for financial metrics

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses standardized XML schemas to define report parameters, enabling consistent report generation across the application
2. Hierarchical Account Structure: Supports nested account representations with configurable depth and grouping options
3. Multi-Currency Support: Implements currency conversion and display options for international financial reporting
4. Calculation Method Flexibility: Provides multiple calculation approaches for financial metrics based on organizational needs
5. Cost Center Integration: Enables filtering and grouping of financial data by organizational cost centers

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach through XML, allowing for extensive customization without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the foundation for report generation, defining both visual presentation and calculation logic. This design supports the needs of international non-profit organizations by accommodating different accounting structures, currencies, and reporting requirements while maintaining consistency in financial presentation across multiple time periods.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Income Expense Multiple Period report with default parameter settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines default parameters for the Income Expense Multiple Period report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, related XML files, display options, and report configuration parameters including account hierarchy, currency settings, cost center options, calculation methods, and formatting preferences. Key parameters include systemsettings, xmlfiles, param_account_hierarchy_c, param_currency, param_multiperiod, and various cost center and calculation options that control how financial data is presented across multiple time periods.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to generate the complete report definition
- `Line 15`: Cost center parameters allow for flexible reporting with options for summary, breakdown, and selective inclusion
- `Line 20`: Column-specific parameters enable different calculation methods for different report columns
