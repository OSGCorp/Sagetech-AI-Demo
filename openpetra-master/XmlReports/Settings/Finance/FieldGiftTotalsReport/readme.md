# XML Field Gift Totals Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. The XML Field Gift Totals Report subproject implements specialized financial reporting capabilities focused on gift tracking and analysis. This component provides a structured way to generate standardized reports showing donation totals across different organizational contexts (worker and field levels) with comprehensive aggregation features.

## Key Technical Features

- Configurable column-based reporting with seven predefined calculation types
- Multi-currency support with standardized formatting options
- Temporal analysis capabilities with month/year range selection
- Dual-context gift tracking (Worker and Field perspectives)
- Aggregated totals with count and amount metrics
- XML-driven configuration for flexible report customization

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Architecture**: Uses declarative XML files to define report structure, columns, and formatting without requiring code changes
2. **Parameterized Reporting**: Supports dynamic report generation based on user-selected date ranges and other criteria
3. **Financial Data Aggregation**: Implements specialized calculation logic for summarizing donation data across organizational hierarchies
4. **Consistent Layout Management**: Employs column width specifications to ensure proper report formatting and readability
5. **Integration with Finance Module**: Functions as a specialized component within OpenPetra's broader financial management capabilities

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files, making the system highly adaptable to changing reporting requirements. The subproject focuses on financial data aggregation and presentation, with particular emphasis on donation tracking across organizational structures. This design allows for consistent reporting while maintaining flexibility for different organizational contexts and time periods.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Field Gift Totals Report in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Field Gift Totals Report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, linked XML files, currency formatting, and report column configurations. The file sets up seven display columns with different calculations including Month, AmountWorker, CountWorker, AmountField, CountField, AmountCombined, and CountCombined. Each column has an assigned width value to control the report layout. Additional parameters define currency format, year range, and month selections for the report generation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to generate the complete report definition
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 7, indicating a responsive design consideration for report rendering
- `Line 15-28`: Column configuration uses indexed parameters to define both calculation type and width for each column
