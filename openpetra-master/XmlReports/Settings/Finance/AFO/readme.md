# XML AFO Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a .NET-based application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and generates standardized reports for accounting purposes. This sub-project implements XML-based Account Financial Overview (AFO) reporting functionality along with configuration parameters for financial data presentation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- XML-based financial report generation
- Standardized account hierarchy implementation
- Period-based financial data presentation
- Configuration-driven report formatting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Framework**: The system uses XML configuration files to define report parameters, enabling flexible report definitions without code changes
2. **Account Hierarchy Implementation**: Implements the STANDARD account hierarchy structure for consistent financial reporting
3. **Period-based Financial Reporting**: Configures reporting periods with defined start points for consistent financial analysis
4. **Parameter-driven Report Generation**: Uses system settings to control report behavior and presentation options

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions and parameters are externalized in XML files. This design separates the reporting logic from the configuration details, allowing for customization of financial reports without modifying application code. The AFO reporting framework provides standardized financial overviews that follow accounting best practices while maintaining flexibility for different organizational needs. The implementation supports the broader financial management capabilities of OpenPetra while focusing specifically on structured financial reporting.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for AFO financial reports specifying system settings and report parameters.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the AFO financial reports in OpenPetra. It sets system settings to true, identifies the current report as 'AFO', specifies the account hierarchy as 'STANDARD', and sets the start period to 1. These parameters configure how financial reports are generated and displayed within the Finance module of OpenPetra.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings flag enables core system configuration options for the report
