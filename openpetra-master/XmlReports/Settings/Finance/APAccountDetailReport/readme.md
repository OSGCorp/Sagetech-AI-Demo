# XML AP Account Detail Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML AP Account Detail Report is a specialized configuration component within OpenPetra's financial reporting system that generates detailed accounts payable transaction reports. This subproject implements XML-based report definition and parameter configuration for AP account analysis, providing these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured financial data presentation with configurable columns (Date, Reference Number, Debits, Credits, Detail)
- Precise account range filtering (e.g., 9100-9200) for targeted financial analysis
- Currency-aware calculation and formatting for international accounting needs
- Ledger-specific reporting with transaction detail extraction

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Configuration: Uses standard.xml to define report structure, column layouts, and calculation parameters
2. Financial Data Filtering: Implements account range parameters to isolate specific AP transaction sets
3. Calculation Type Mapping: Associates columns with appropriate calculation methods (e.g., debit/credit handling)
4. Currency-Aware Formatting: Supports international financial reporting with proper currency display
5. Column Width Management: Defines precise column widths for consistent report presentation

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, allowing report definitions to be modified without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both visual presentation and calculation logic. This separation of concerns enables accounting teams to adjust report parameters while maintaining calculation integrity. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial reporting framework, leveraging the system's transaction processing capabilities while providing specialized AP account detail reporting.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for AP Account Detail Report defining parameters, columns, and calculation settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the AP Account Detail Report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, column configurations, and calculation parameters. The file defines five display columns (Date, Reference Number, Debits, Credits, and Detail) with their respective widths and calculation types. It also includes parameters for account range filtering (9100-9200), currency formatting, ledger number, and various accounting totals. The configuration maps column names to their respective index positions and sets default values for financial calculations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables global configuration access
- `Line 4`: XML files parameter links multiple configuration files for report generation
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 5 columns
- `Line 22`: Currency format parameters control financial data presentation
- `Line 31-35`: Column mapping parameters create references between column names and indices
