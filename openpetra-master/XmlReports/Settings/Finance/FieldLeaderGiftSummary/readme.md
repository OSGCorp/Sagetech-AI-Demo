# XML Field Leader Gift Summary Report Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a financial management system that helps non-profit organizations track donations and generate financial reports. The XML Field Leader Gift Summary Report subproject implements a specialized reporting mechanism for field leaders to view gift summaries with configurable display options. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Standardized financial reporting for field leaders
- Configurable column display with up to 5 data columns
- Flexible data presentation with partner and motivation details
- Currency-aware financial calculations and formatting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The report structure is defined through XML configuration files that specify column properties, calculations, and display parameters
2. **Modular Column Definition**: Each report column is independently configured with specific data sources, widths, and calculation methods
3. **Financial Data Integration**: The report connects to Petra's core financial data structures to retrieve gift information and partner details
4. **Formatting Controls**: Specialized parameters manage currency formatting, year-to-date calculations, and field selection options

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach where report behavior is defined in XML rather than code. This promotes maintainability by separating report structure from implementation logic. The standard.xml file serves as the primary configuration template, defining column calculations for Partner Key, Partner Name, Motivation Detail, Motivation Group, and Gift Amount. The design supports financial reporting requirements specific to field leaders while leveraging Petra's underlying data management capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Field Leader Gift Summary report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Field Leader Gift Summary report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, related XML files, and report display properties including a maximum of 5 display columns. The file configures each column with specific calculations (Partner Key, Partner Name, Motivation Detail, Motivation Group, and Gift Amount), column widths, and year-to-date settings. Additional parameters control currency format, gift amount column reference, and field selection options. The file serves as a template for generating standardized financial reports for field leaders.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to generate the complete report structure
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 5, affecting report layout and data presentation
- `Line 7-8`: Configures base currency and sets a 4-year timespan for financial data analysis
