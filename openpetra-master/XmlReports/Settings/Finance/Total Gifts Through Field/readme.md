# XML Total Gifts Through Field Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Total Gifts Through Field Report is a specialized financial reporting component within OpenPetra's reporting infrastructure. This subproject implements configuration-driven financial data aggregation and presentation specifically for tracking gift transactions through various field offices. The report utilizes XML-based parameter definitions to control data processing, time periods, and presentation formats for financial gift analysis.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial gift reporting across multiple field locations
- Temporal analysis of gift transactions with both detailed (4-year) and summary (8-year) views
- Currency standardization using base currency for consistent financial comparisons
- Parameter-driven report generation without requiring code changes

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML Configuration Framework: Uses a layered XML configuration approach that references multiple definition files (totalgiftsthroughfield.xml, finance.xml, common.xml) for modular report construction
2. Parameter-Driven Processing: Implements system settings and report parameters that control data selection, filtering, and presentation logic
3. Multi-timeframe Analysis: Supports both detailed short-term and broader long-term financial analysis through configurable time period parameters
4. Currency Normalization: Standardizes financial data to a base currency to enable meaningful cross-field comparisons

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's configuration-over-code philosophy, allowing report customization through XML parameter adjustments rather than code changes. The report integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial tracking system while providing specialized views for field-based gift analysis. This design supports the non-profit focus of the application by enabling organizations to track donation flows across distributed operational locations.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the 'Total Gifts Through Field' financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Total Gifts Through Field' financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, related XML files (totalgiftsthroughfield.xml, finance.xml, common.xml), the current report name, currency setting (Base), and time period parameters for detailed (4 years) and summary (8 years) views. These parameters control how financial gift data is processed and displayed in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Links multiple XML files together to form a complete report definition
