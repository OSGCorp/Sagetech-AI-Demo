# XML Trial Balance Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C#/.NET program that provides comprehensive administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles accounting workflows and financial reporting while supporting international operations across multiple currencies. This sub-project implements the Trial Balance reporting functionality along with its configuration parameters, providing a critical financial reporting capability to the OpenPetra system:

- Configurable financial statement generation
- Account hierarchy representation
- Multi-currency reporting support
- Flexible period-based reporting
- Customizable filtering and sorting options

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: The XML-based configuration approach allows for report customization without code changes
2. **Parameter-Driven Reporting**: Report behavior and appearance are controlled through well-defined parameters in the standard.xml file
3. **Financial Hierarchy Support**: The system accommodates different account hierarchy types for organizational flexibility
4. **Currency Management**: Built-in support for handling multiple currencies and exchange rates in financial reporting
5. **Filtering Framework**: Comprehensive filtering capabilities for accounts and cost centers

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined through XML structures. This provides a clean separation between the reporting engine and the specific report implementations. The Trial Balance report serves as a fundamental financial statement that presents account balances at a specific point in time, supporting both detailed and summary views. The configuration parameters allow for extensive customization to meet various organizational reporting requirements while maintaining consistency in the underlying data processing.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the Trial Balance financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Trial Balance report in OpenPetra's financial module. It specifies required XML files, report settings, and default parameter values that control report behavior. Key parameters include account hierarchy type, currency settings, reporting period options, sorting preferences, account and cost center filtering options, and display settings. The file establishes default values that will be used when generating trial balance reports in the finance system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to generate the complete report definition
- `Line 7`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the number of columns shown in the report output
- `Line 12-14`: Multiple mutually exclusive time period selection options (quarter, period, daterange) with default values
