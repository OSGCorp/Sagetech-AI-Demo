# XML One Year Monthly Giving Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML One Year Monthly Giving Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's financial reporting infrastructure. This subproject implements a standardized XML-based configuration framework for generating comprehensive monthly donor contribution reports across a one-year period. The configuration defines a structured data presentation model that transforms raw financial transaction data into actionable donor giving insights for non-profit organizations.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial reporting with 15 distinct data columns
- Donor-centric transaction aggregation across monthly periods
- Customizable currency formatting and calculation rules
- Flexible sorting and organization of financial data
- Year-to-date calculation capabilities for cumulative analysis

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure, allowing for modification without code changes
2. **Column-Based Data Architecture**: Implements a 15-column model (donor details + 12 months + total) with configurable widths and calculation types
3. **Financial Data Aggregation**: Supports various calculation methods for summarizing transaction data
4. **Presentation Layer Integration**: Connects with OpenPetra's broader reporting infrastructure to maintain consistent styling and output formats
5. **Sorting and Filtering Framework**: Provides configurable parameters for organizing donor information in meaningful ways

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report structure and behavior are externalized in XML, promoting maintainability and extensibility. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial reporting capabilities while providing specialized functionality for tracking donor giving patterns across monthly periods. This design allows non-profit organizations to efficiently analyze donor contributions over time without requiring custom development.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the One Year Monthly Giving financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the One Year Monthly Giving financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, referenced XML files, and report column configurations. The file establishes 15 display columns including donor information and monthly giving amounts (January through December) plus a total column. Each column has defined widths, calculation types, and year-to-date settings. Additional parameters control currency formatting, recipient information, and sorting order, providing a complete configuration for generating monthly donor giving reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-5`: Core system configuration parameters that link this report to other XML files in the reporting system
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 15 columns for display purposes
- `Line 7-8`: Parameters for recipient and currency selection that affect report filtering
- `Line 9-59`: Column-specific parameters with decimal-encoded width values using scientific notation format
