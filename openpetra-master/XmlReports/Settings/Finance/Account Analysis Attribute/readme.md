# XML Account Analysis Attribute Report Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a comprehensive open-source application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The XML Account Analysis Attribute Report sub-project implements specialized financial reporting functionality with attribute-based analysis capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Detailed financial data presentation with configurable columns for debits, credits, and balances
- Analysis attribute filtering and reporting for enhanced financial insights
- Customizable report parameters for account hierarchies and cost centers
- Flexible currency handling for international organizations

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses structured XML files to define report parameters, layouts, and calculations without requiring code changes
2. Financial Data Aggregation: Supports complex financial data grouping and calculations based on analysis attributes
3. Modular Report Structure: Implements a component-based approach with configurable column positions and widths
4. Parameterized Reporting: Provides extensive customization options through default values and user-definable parameters

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven design pattern where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This approach separates the reporting logic from the presentation layer, enabling flexible customization without code modifications. The report engine processes these configurations to generate detailed financial analyses with attribute-based filtering, supporting OpenPetra's mission to provide comprehensive financial management tools for non-profit organizations. The implementation emphasizes reusability and maintainability through standardized parameter definitions and calculation methods.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Account Analysis Attribute report in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Account Analysis Attribute report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, display settings, and report parameters. The file configures column positions, widths, and calculations for financial data presentation including debits, credits, transaction details, balances, and analysis attributes. It sets default values for account hierarchies, currency settings, sorting preferences, and ledger numbers. The configuration enables detailed financial analysis with specific parameters for cost centers, account codes, and analysis attributes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML dependencies for report generation
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 8, affecting report layout
- `Line 56-57`: Enables analysis attributes functionality with dedicated columns
- `Line 23-26`: Implements flexible account selection through multiple selection methods
