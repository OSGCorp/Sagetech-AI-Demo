# XML Recipient Tax Deduct Percentage Report Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a financial management system for non-profit organizations that includes comprehensive reporting capabilities. The XML Recipient Tax Deduct Percentage Report subproject implements specialized tax reporting functionality that allows organizations to generate documentation on tax-deductible percentages for recipients. This subproject provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Generation of standardized tax deduction percentage reports for recipients
- Configurable report parameters through XML definition files
- Partner-specific tax deduction reporting with flexible selection criteria
- Integration with the broader finance module reporting framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The subproject uses XML configuration files to define report parameters, making it highly customizable without code changes
2. **Partner Selection Mechanism**: Supports different recipient selection modes, with 'one_partner' as the default configuration
3. **Finance Module Integration**: Seamlessly connects with Petra's finance module to access relevant tax and transaction data
4. **Parameter Initialization**: Implements default parameter values that can be overridden at runtime

## Overview

The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined in XML files like `standard.xml`. This design separates report configuration from implementation logic, enabling administrators to modify report parameters without developer intervention. The subproject initializes with sensible defaults while allowing customization for specific organizational needs. The reporting engine integrates with Petra's partner management system to retrieve recipient data and calculate appropriate tax deduction percentages based on financial transactions recorded in the system.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the Recipient Tax Deduct Percentage report in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameters for the Recipient Tax Deduct Percentage report in OpenPetra's finance module. It sets system settings to true, specifies the report name, and initializes recipient selection to 'one_partner' with a zero key value. The file establishes the starting configuration values that control how the tax deduction percentage report operates when generated for recipients.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Sets systemsettings parameter to true, indicating this report uses system-wide configuration settings
- `Line 5`: Default recipient selection is set to 'one_partner', suggesting the report initially targets individual partner records rather than groups
