# XML Donor By Motivation Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Donor By Motivation Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates donor analysis reports categorized by motivation factors. This subproject implements report configuration and parameter management through XML-based definitions, providing a standardized approach to financial donor reporting with customizable filtering options.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable donor reporting with motivation-based categorization
- Parameter-driven filtering of donor records
- XML-based report definition for consistent report generation
- Support for specialized donor selection criteria

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML Configuration Framework**: Uses XML files to define report parameters and default settings, allowing for consistent report generation without code changes
2. **Boolean Parameter System**: Implements a set of boolean flags that control report behavior and filtering logic
3. **Donor Selection Logic**: Provides filtering mechanisms for active donors, mailing address types, family grouping, and solicitation preferences
4. **Finance Integration**: Connects to the broader finance subsystem while focusing specifically on donor motivation analysis

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach through XML definitions, separating report logic from presentation concerns. The standard.xml file serves as the configuration backbone, defining default parameter values that control report behavior. This design enables non-technical users to generate complex financial reports while allowing developers to extend functionality by modifying XML definitions rather than application code. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader finance and donor management systems while maintaining a focused purpose on motivation-based donor analysis.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining default parameters for the Donor By Motivation report.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameter settings for the Finance/Donor By Motivation report. It establishes four boolean parameters that control report behavior: param_active (set to true), param_mailing_addresses_only (true), param_families_only (true), and param_exclude_no_solicitations (true). These parameters likely determine which donors are included in the report based on their status, address type, family grouping, and solicitation preferences.
