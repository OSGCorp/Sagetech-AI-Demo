# XML Balance Sheet Standard Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a comprehensive open-source application that helps non-profit organizations manage their administrative and financial operations. This sub-project implements the standard balance sheet report configuration through XML-based definitions. The XML Balance Sheet Standard Report provides the structural template that determines how financial balance sheet data is processed, calculated, and presented within the reporting framework.

This configuration provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Flexible financial data presentation with five distinct calculation columns
- Comparative financial analysis through year-over-year variance calculations
- Customizable reporting depth and cost center filtering
- Currency formatting and display standardization
- Parameterized report generation for consistent financial statements

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Structure**: Uses XML to define the report layout, calculations, and presentation rules without requiring code changes
2. **Multi-period Financial Comparison**: Configures display columns for current year, previous year, and variance calculations
3. **Financial Calculation Framework**: Defines the mathematical relationships between financial data points
4. **Presentation Layer Configuration**: Controls formatting, depth of reporting, and display preferences
5. **System Integration Parameters**: Specifies dependencies and integration points with the broader OpenPetra financial system

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-as-code approach, allowing report definitions to be version-controlled and deployed independently of application code. The XML structure provides a clear separation between data processing logic and presentation concerns, enabling consistent reporting across the application. This design supports extensibility through parameter customization while maintaining a standardized financial reporting framework.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Balance Sheet Standard report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Balance Sheet Standard report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, and report configuration options including currency settings, calculation methods, and display preferences. The file configures five display columns showing different financial calculations: Actual Selected Year, Actual Previous Year, Actual End of Previous Year, Variance, and Variance Percentage. Additional parameters control depth of reporting, cost center options, and currency formatting. This configuration serves as a template that determines how the balance sheet report will be generated and displayed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that provide the core report structure and functionality
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 5, controlling the report layout
- `Line 13-22`: Configures multiple calculation columns with different financial perspectives and variance calculations
- `Line 23`: Sets year-to-date parameter to false, indicating full period reporting
- `Line 28-31`: Controls cost center reporting options with multiple related parameters
