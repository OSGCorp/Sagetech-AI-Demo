## XML Gift Batch Detail Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Gift Batch Detail Report is a configuration-driven component of OpenPetra's finance module that generates detailed reports of gift batch transactions. This subproject implements standardized report definitions through XML configuration, allowing for consistent and customizable financial reporting capabilities. The report configuration provides critical visibility into donation transactions, supporting OpenPetra's core mission of helping non-profit organizations manage their financial administration efficiently.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured parameter definition for gift batch reporting
- Currency display configuration options
- Integration with OpenPetra's broader finance module
- Standardized report formatting and output

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses declarative XML to define report parameters, ensuring separation of reporting logic from application code
2. Parameterized Reporting: Supports configurable parameters including system settings and currency display options
3. Finance Module Integration: Connects with OpenPetra's financial transaction tracking system
4. Standardized Report Structure: Maintains consistent reporting formats for gift batch details

## Overview

The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design promotes maintainability by allowing report modifications without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the primary configuration point, defining critical parameters that control report behavior and presentation. The subproject fits within OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer, providing a standardized interface for generating financial reports that support the organization's non-profit administration needs.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Gift Batch Detail report that defines basic parameters including system settings and currency options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Gift Batch Detail report in OpenPetra's finance module. It sets three key parameters: systemsettings (boolean true), currentReport (string value "Gift Batch Detail"), and param_currency (string value "Transaction"). These parameters likely control how the gift batch detail report functions, including its currency display options.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: The systemsettings parameter with boolean true value likely enables system-wide configuration for this report
