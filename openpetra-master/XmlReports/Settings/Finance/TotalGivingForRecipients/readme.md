# XML Total Giving For Recipients Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Total Giving For Recipients Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra's finance module that generates comprehensive donor contribution summaries. This sub-project implements standardized report definitions and parameter configurations through XML-based declarative structures. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Multi-year financial contribution tracking for recipients
- Customizable report column definitions with precise width specifications
- Flexible partner/donor classification filtering
- Standardized currency formatting and presentation

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The report structure is defined through declarative XML, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. Hierarchical Parameter Organization: Parameters are logically grouped for recipient selection, currency handling, and data extraction
3. Multi-year Data Presentation: The architecture supports displaying multiple years of giving data in a single report view
4. Columnar Data Structure: Report data is organized in a columnar format with configurable widths and properties

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design enables non-developers to modify report structures and promotes separation between the reporting engine and report definitions. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both the visual presentation and data extraction parameters. The report integrates with OpenPetra's partner and financial subsystems to retrieve and format donor contribution data across multiple fiscal years.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Total Giving For Recipients financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Total Giving For Recipients report in OpenPetra's finance module. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report identification, and display properties. The file configures report columns including partner key, donor name, donor class, and yearly giving amounts for the current and three previous years. It also defines column widths and parameter settings for recipient selection, currency formatting, field selection, and data extraction options.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML data sources that are combined for the report generation
- `Line 6`: Limits display columns to 7, suggesting a responsive or print-oriented design constraint
- `Line 14-15`: Implements field selection parameters that allow filtering report content
