# XML Income Expense Statement Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Income Expense Statement Report is a configuration-driven financial reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized financial comparisons between actual and budgeted figures. This sub-project implements a flexible XML-based configuration system for defining report parameters along with the processing logic to transform accounting data into formatted financial statements. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Parameterized report generation through standardized XML configuration files
- Multiple comparison types (monthly, quarterly, year-to-date) in a single report framework
- Variance calculations in both absolute and percentage formats
- Customizable column definitions for different financial analysis needs

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration Architecture: Uses declarative XML files to define report parameters, calculation types, and display options without requiring code changes
2. Modular Configuration Structure: References shared configuration components (incomeexpensestatement.xml, finance.xml, common.xml) to maintain consistency across report variants
3. Flexible Column Definition System: Supports multiple calculation types and comparison methods through parameterized column specifications
4. Hierarchical Data Presentation: Configurable depth settings allow for different levels of financial detail in the same report structure

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, allowing financial reports to be customized without programming changes. Each report variant (monthly, quarterly, YTD) shares the same underlying processing engine but with different parameter sets. The system supports multiple currency display formats, cost center filtering options, and calculation types that can be combined to create comprehensive financial statements. The XML-based approach ensures consistency across reports while providing flexibility for different organizational reporting needs.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard Actual vs Budget with Variance (Month).xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for an Income Expense Statement report comparing actual vs budget with variance.
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Income Expense Statement report settings in OpenPetra's finance module.
- `standard Actual vs Budget with % Variance (Quarter).xml` : XML configuration file for a quarterly Income Expense Statement report comparing actual vs budget with percentage variance.
- `standard YTD Actual vs Budget with Variances.xml` : XML configuration file for a standard Income Expense Statement report with YTD Actual vs Budget comparisons and variances.
- `standard Actual vs Budget with Variance (Quarter).xml` : XML configuration file for a quarterly Income Expense Statement report comparing actual vs budget with variance.
- `standard Actual vs Budget with Variances.xml` : XML configuration for an Income Expense Statement report comparing actual vs budget with variance calculations.
- `standard Actual vs Budget with % Variance (Month).xml` : XML configuration file for an Income Expense Statement report that compares actual vs budget with percentage variance by month.

## Files
### standard Actual vs Budget with % Variance (Month).xml
