# XML Stewardship Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Stewardship Report is a configuration-driven financial reporting component within OpenPetra that enables standardized generation of financial reports for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements XML-based configuration management for financial reporting parameters along with the supporting infrastructure to generate consistent, customizable reports across the system. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial report generation with multiple report types
- Flexible delivery method specification (Email or ByField)
- Standardized currency and period settings across reports
- Parameter-driven report behavior control

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML Configuration Schema: Defines a structured approach to report configuration with clear parameter hierarchies and inheritance
2. Report Type Specialization: Supports multiple report types (HOSA, Stewardship, Fees) with type-specific parameters
3. Delivery Method Configuration: Enables different delivery mechanisms to be specified per report type
4. Period Management: Provides standardized handling of financial reporting periods across the system
5. Boolean Feature Flags: Implements toggles for enabling/disabling specific report functionality

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration-driven behavior through XML definitions, maintaining consistent reporting standards while allowing customization. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining default parameters that control report generation behavior. This approach supports the non-profit focus of OpenPetra by enabling flexible financial reporting that can adapt to different organizational needs while maintaining consistency in output formats and delivery methods.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file defining default parameters for Stewardship financial reports in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines default parameters for the Stewardship financial reporting module in OpenPetra. It establishes initial settings for report generation including year-end period, report period, currency settings, and various report options. The file configures three main report types (HOSA, Stewardship, and Fees) with their delivery methods (Email or ByField). Parameters include boolean flags to enable/disable report types, delivery method selections, currency settings, and period specifications that control the financial reporting behavior.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5-6`: Defines the report identification and period settings that determine the financial timeframe for reporting
- `Line 7-8`: Controls ICH (International Clearing House) number and currency settings, critical for multi-currency operations in non-profit accounting
- `Line 9-14`: Configures three different report types (HOSA, Stewardship, Fees) with their delivery methods, allowing flexible reporting options
