# XML Donor By Amount Report Of Petra

The Petra application is a free, open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. The XML Donor By Amount Report sub-project implements a specialized financial reporting capability that allows organizations to analyze and report on donor contributions based on monetary thresholds. This component provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Configurable donor contribution analysis by amount ranges
- Currency-specific reporting parameters
- Flexible donor filtering mechanisms
- Customizable gift count thresholds

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The report structure and parameters are defined in standard.xml, allowing for consistent report generation without code changes
2. Parameterized Filtering System: Supports multiple filtering dimensions including gift amounts, donor status, and address requirements
3. Currency-Aware Processing: Built-in support for handling different currencies in financial reporting
4. Family/Individual Donor Distinction: Capability to filter and report on both family units and individual donors

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach where report parameters are externalized in XML format. This design promotes separation between the reporting engine and the specific report definitions, enhancing maintainability. The standard.xml file serves as the configuration backbone, defining all filtering options and report parameters. The implementation supports comprehensive donor analysis with fine-grained control over which donors appear in reports based on their giving patterns, status, and organizational relationships.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a donor-by-amount financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines standard parameters for the Finance/Donor By Amount report in OpenPetra. It configures filtering options for donor reporting including currency settings, gift amount ranges (minimum and maximum), number of gifts constraints, and donor filtering options. Key parameters include currency selection, gift amount thresholds, gift count limits, and boolean flags for filtering active donors, mailing addresses, families, and excluding no-solicitation contacts.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Base currency parameter serves as the default currency for financial calculations in the report
- `Line 4`: Toggle for calculating amounts per single gift versus total gifts
- `Line 9-11`: Boolean parameters control donor filtering logic, affecting which contacts appear in the report
