# XML Executive Summary Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Executive Summary Report is a configuration-driven component that generates standardized financial reports within the OpenPetra system. This subproject implements the definition and parameter structure for executive-level financial reporting, providing a consistent interface for generating summary financial data across the non-profit organization. The configuration approach allows for standardized yet customizable reporting capabilities within OpenPetra's broader financial management system.

Key capabilities provided to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized financial reporting parameters for executive-level summaries
- Configuration-based report generation without code changes
- Integration with OpenPetra's account hierarchy system
- Period-based financial data presentation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses XML structure to define report parameters, enabling separation of report definition from application code
2. **Parameter Standardization**: Establishes default parameters that ensure consistent report generation across the application
3. **Account Hierarchy Integration**: Links reports to the STANDARD account hierarchy, allowing for organized financial data presentation
4. **Period-Based Reporting**: Configures reporting periods to align with organizational financial cycles

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach that separates report definitions from application code. The standard.xml file serves as the foundation for Executive Summary reports, defining critical parameters that control report behavior and presentation. This design allows for maintainability and extensibility, as report modifications can often be made through configuration changes rather than code updates. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial data structures while providing specialized executive-level reporting capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Executive Summary financial report with default parameters.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameters for the Executive Summary financial report in OpenPetra. It sets four key parameters: systemsettings (true), currentReport (Executive Summary), param_account_hierarchy_c (STANDARD), and param_start_period_i (1). These parameters likely control the report's behavior, including which account hierarchy to use and which period to start reporting from.
