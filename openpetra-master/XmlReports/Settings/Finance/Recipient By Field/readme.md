# XML Recipient By Field Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a comprehensive open-source application that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. This sub-project implements specialized reporting functionality that organizes financial recipients by field, enabling organizations to analyze their financial distribution patterns geographically or by organizational structure. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured financial recipient data aggregation by field/region
- Configurable report generation with parameter-based filtering
- Integration with the broader OpenPetra ledger system
- XML-based configuration for flexible report customization

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: The subproject uses XML configuration files to define report parameters and behavior, allowing for customization without code changes
2. Ledger Selection System: Supports filtering by specific ledgers or including all ledgers based on configuration parameters
3. System Settings Integration: Can incorporate system-wide settings into report generation through the 'systemsettings' parameter
4. Parameter-Driven Architecture: Report behavior and content are controlled through clearly defined parameters in the standard.xml configuration file

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report generation logic is separated from the report parameters and settings. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining how recipient data should be organized and which ledgers should be included. This design promotes maintainability by isolating configuration from implementation and enables non-technical users to customize reports through parameter adjustments rather than code changes. The subproject integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial management capabilities while maintaining a focused purpose of organizing recipient data by geographical or organizational fields.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for recipient by field financial reports.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for financial reports that organize recipients by field. It contains three parameters: 'systemsettings' (boolean, set to true), 'param_ledgers' (empty string), and 'param_all_ledgers' (boolean, set to false). These parameters likely control which ledgers are included in the report and whether system settings should be applied.
