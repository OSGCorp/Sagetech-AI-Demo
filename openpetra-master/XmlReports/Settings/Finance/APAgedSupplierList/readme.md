# XML AP Aged Supplier List Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a free, open-source administration system designed for non-profit organizations that helps manage accounting, contact management, and other administrative functions. The XML AP Aged Supplier List Report subproject implements a specialized financial reporting capability that provides detailed aging analysis of accounts payable obligations. This report is configured through XML-based definitions that establish the structure and presentation of supplier payment data.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured presentation of accounts payable aging data in configurable time periods
- Flexible column configuration for financial document tracking
- Support for currency-specific reporting and calculations
- Conditional filtering options for discounted invoices

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Configuration: The report structure is defined through declarative XML, allowing for easy modification without code changes
2. Columnar Financial Data Organization: Nine distinct columns present document codes, references, and aging periods with appropriate calculations
3. Parameterized Report Generation: The configuration supports runtime parameters for filtering and display options
4. Currency-Aware Financial Calculations: The system handles currency-specific calculations and formatting for international financial operations

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This design separates the report structure from the rendering engine, promoting maintainability and extensibility. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both the visual presentation and calculation logic for the accounts payable aging report, which is a critical component for financial management in non-profit organizations using OpenPetra.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Accounts Payable Aged Supplier List report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Accounts Payable Aged Supplier List report in OpenPetra's financial reporting system. It specifies system settings, related XML files, report identification, and display configuration. The file configures nine display columns with their respective calculations and widths, including Document Code, Reference, Discount, various aging periods (Overdue 30+, Overdue, Due, Due 30+, Due 60+), and Total Due. Additional parameters control invoice display options, discounted-only filtering, and currency settings.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that work together to build the complete report structure
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter controls the number of columns shown in the report
- `Line 7-9`: Boolean parameters control filtering behavior for the report display
