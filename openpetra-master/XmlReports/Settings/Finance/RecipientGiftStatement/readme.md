# XML Recipient Gift Statement Report Of Petra

The Petra application is a comprehensive open-source system designed to help non-profit organizations manage their administrative operations. The XML Recipient Gift Statement Report subproject implements a specialized financial reporting component that generates detailed gift statements for recipients within the finance system. This module provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Configurable gift statement generation for financial reporting
- Customizable display columns with flexible formatting options
- Comprehensive donor and recipient data integration
- Parameterized currency formatting and calculation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration Architecture**: The system uses XML configuration files to define report parameters, data sources, and display settings without requiring code changes
2. **Columnar Data Representation**: The report implements an 11-column structure that organizes donor information, gift details, and financial data in a standardized format
3. **Financial Data Processing**: Specialized handling for currency values, including formatting options and calculation parameters
4. **Filtering and Sorting Mechanisms**: Built-in capabilities for filtering recipients and sorting both donors and recipients according to configurable criteria

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-driven approach where report behavior is defined through XML specifications rather than hard-coded logic. This design provides flexibility for customizing reports without modifying application code. The system integrates with OpenPetra's finance module to access donor and gift data, applying the defined formatting and calculation rules to generate consistent, professional gift statements. The infrastructure layer positioning allows the report to leverage core system capabilities while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Recipient Gift Statement report in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Recipient Gift Statement report in OpenPetra's finance system. It specifies report settings including system parameters, XML data sources, report type, and display configuration. The file defines 11 display columns with their calculations, widths, and formatting options. Columns include donor information (key, name, address), gift details (date, receipt number, motivation code), and financial data (gift amounts). The configuration also includes parameters for currency formatting, recipient filtering, and sorting options for both donors and recipients.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-5`: Core system configuration parameters that link this report to other XML files in the finance module
- `Line 7-10`: Main report parameters defining report type, recipient selection, and currency handling
- `Line 11-46`: Column configuration with detailed parameter sets for each display column including width and calculation type
- `Line 47-50`: Currency formatting and recipient filtering parameters that control financial data presentation
