# XML Account Detail Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Account Detail Report is a configuration-driven financial reporting component within OpenPetra that generates detailed account transaction reports. This subproject implements the report definition structure and rendering capabilities through XML configuration, providing a standardized way to display financial transaction details across the accounting system. The configuration architecture allows for flexible report customization while maintaining consistent data presentation.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based report configuration for financial transaction details
- Structured column layout system with precise positioning and width controls
- Configurable transaction data presentation (Cost Centre, Account Code, Debit/Credit amounts)
- Balance calculation capabilities (Start/End Balance columns)
- Support for transaction narrative display
- Parameterized reporting with boolean feature flags
- Currency handling and formatting for financial data

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Structure**: Uses XML to define the report layout and behavior without requiring code changes
2. **Column-Based Data Presentation**: Implements a seven-column layout system for transaction details with configurable positioning
3. **Financial Calculation Integration**: Connects with OpenPetra's accounting engine to perform balance calculations
4. **Hierarchical Account Representation**: Supports displaying account data in hierarchical relationships
5. **Configurable Sorting and Filtering**: Allows customization of how transaction data is organized and filtered
6. **Period-Based Reporting**: Implements time-based financial analysis through period reporting flags

The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, enabling report customization while maintaining consistency across the financial reporting system. This design supports OpenPetra's goal of providing flexible administrative tools for non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : Configuration file for the Account Detail financial report in OpenPetra, defining parameters and column layout.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines the parameters for the 'Account Detail' financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML dependencies, and report configuration options including account hierarchy, currency settings, and sorting preferences. The file primarily configures the column layout for the report with seven columns displaying transaction details: Cost Centre, Account Code, Debit, Credit, Transaction Narrative, Start Balance, and End Balance. Each column has defined position, width, and calculation parameters. The file also includes boolean flags for features like period reporting and analysis attributes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple XML files that are combined to generate the complete report definition
- `Line 19`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter defines the total number of columns in the report layout
- `Line 21-47`: Column configuration uses a pattern of position, indentation, width, and calculation type for each column
