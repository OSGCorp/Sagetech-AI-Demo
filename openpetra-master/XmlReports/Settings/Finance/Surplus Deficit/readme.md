# XML Surplus Deficit Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Surplus Deficit Report is a configuration-driven financial reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized surplus/deficit financial statements. This subproject implements XML-based report definition and rendering capabilities along with financial calculation logic for non-profit accounting needs. The report provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable financial report generation with customizable column layouts
- Multi-currency transaction display and calculation
- Account hierarchy representation in financial statements
- Period-based financial data aggregation and comparison

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration Framework**: The standard.xml file defines all report parameters, allowing for flexible report customization without code changes
2. **Multi-Currency Support**: Built-in handling of transaction currencies with appropriate conversion and display options
3. **Financial Data Structuring**: Implements account hierarchy representation and balance calculation logic
4. **Columnar Report Layout**: Configurable six-column layout with precise positioning and width specifications for consistent financial reporting

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach where report behavior is defined through XML rather than code. This provides a separation between the report definition and the rendering engine, making it easier to create new financial report variants. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining everything from visual presentation parameters to financial calculation rules. This design supports the non-profit accounting needs of OpenPetra users while maintaining flexibility for different organizational reporting requirements.

## Business Functions

### Financial Reporting
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Surplus Deficit financial report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Surplus Deficit financial report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, related XML files, report display properties, and financial calculation parameters. The file configures column positions, widths, and content types for a 6-column report showing Debit, Credit, Transaction Currency, Transaction Narrative, Start Balance, and End Balance. It also sets account hierarchy, currency settings, period options, and sorting preferences for financial data presentation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References multiple dependent XML files that provide additional functionality
- `Line 8`: Limits display columns to 6, controlling report layout
- `Line 13-15`: Configures period display options with boolean flags for quarter, period, and daterange
- `Line 20-35`: Defines precise column positioning and width specifications for report layout
- `Line 36-41`: Maps specific financial calculations to each display column
