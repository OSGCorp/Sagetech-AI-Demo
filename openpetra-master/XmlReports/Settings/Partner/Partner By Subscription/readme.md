# XML Partner By Subscription Report

The XML Partner By Subscription Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra system that generates subscription-based partner information reports. This module leverages XML configuration to define structured partner data output with consistent formatting and filtering capabilities.

## Key Technical Features

- **XML-Driven Configuration**: Uses declarative XML schema to define report structure, columns, and behavior
- **Parameterized Filtering**: Supports filtering for active partners, mailing addresses, and solicitation preferences
- **Structured Data Output**: Organizes partner information in a standardized columnar format
- **Sorting Capabilities**: Implements multi-level sorting by Partner Name, Address Type, and validity dates
- **Display Customization**: Configures column widths and visibility for optimal data presentation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Standardized Column Definitions**: Eight core partner data columns with predefined widths and formatting
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Partner information is structured with primary and related attributes
3. **Conditional Data Filtering**: Implements business rules for excluding specific partner categories
4. **Metadata-Driven Rendering**: Report appearance and behavior controlled through configuration rather than code

## Architecture Overview

The report operates within OpenPetra's reporting infrastructure, consuming partner data from the system's data layer and transforming it according to the XML configuration. The architecture follows a declarative approach where report behavior is externalized in configuration, allowing for modifications without code changes. This design supports OpenPetra's broader goals of providing flexible administrative tools for non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the 'Partner By Subscription' report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Partner By Subscription' report in OpenPetra. It specifies report settings including XML data source, column definitions, sorting options, and display preferences. The file configures eight display columns showing partner information (Partner Key, Partner Class, Partner Name, Street Name, Post Code, City, Country, Primary Phone) with specified column widths. It also defines sort order by Partner Name, Address Type, and Address valid from date, and includes filtering options for active partners, mailing addresses only, and excluding no-solicitation contacts.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables access to global configuration settings
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the visible columns to 8 despite defining 10 columns total
- `Line 13`: Hidden columns 9-10 are used for sorting but not displayed in the report
- `Line 32`: Column widths use both integer and decimal notation for different precision requirements
