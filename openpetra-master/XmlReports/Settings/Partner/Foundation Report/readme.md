# XML Foundation Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Foundation Report is a configuration-driven component within OpenPetra that defines structured reporting capabilities for foundation data. This subproject implements XML-based report definitions and parameter configurations that enable standardized data presentation for non-profit organizations. The component serves as a critical reporting interface for foundation-related information within the broader OpenPetra administration system.

## Key Technical Capabilities

- XML-based report configuration for consistent data presentation
- Structured column definitions with precise width and data type specifications
- Parameter-driven report generation for foundation entity information
- Support for diverse data fields including keys, names, addresses, and contact details
- Calculation parameter assignment for data processing requirements

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Report structures are defined through XML configuration rather than code, allowing for flexible report modification without programming changes
2. **Standardized Column Framework**: The system implements a 12-column layout with specific width allocations for consistent report presentation
3. **Type-Specific Data Handling**: Each column is configured with appropriate data types to ensure proper formatting and calculation of foundation data
4. **System Parameter Integration**: The report configuration connects with broader system parameters to maintain consistency across the application

## Architecture
The XML Foundation Report operates within the Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer of OpenPetra, providing a bridge between raw foundation data and structured report presentation. The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, enabling report modifications without requiring code changes while maintaining consistent data representation for foundation entities.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining column settings for the Foundation Report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Foundation Report in OpenPetra's reporting system. It specifies column settings for displaying foundation data including keys, names, owners, addresses, and contact information. The file establishes 12 columns with specific widths and data types for each field. Parameters include system settings, XML file references, and column-specific configurations. Each column is assigned a calculation parameter and width value, creating a structured layout for foundation information display. The configuration supports various foundation data points including submission dates, review information, phone numbers, and email addresses.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables core functionality for the report
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'brieffoundationreport.xml' for report structure
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns as 12, controlling report width
- `Line 7`: Specifies that report represents 'an extract' of data
