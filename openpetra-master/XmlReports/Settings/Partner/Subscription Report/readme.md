## XML Subscription Report

The XML Subscription Report is a configuration-driven reporting component of OpenPetra that generates standardized subscription reports for non-profit organizations. This subproject is implemented through XML configuration files that define report parameters, display properties, and data extraction rules.

The architecture is based on declarative XML definitions that specify:

- Report column configurations with precise width and calculation types
- Partner selection criteria for report generation
- Data extraction parameters and filtering rules
- Output formatting specifications

### Key Technical Capabilities

- Configurable multi-column report generation with nine standard display fields
- Type-specific data processing based on XML attribute definitions
- Flexible partner selection and filtering mechanisms
- Customizable ordering and display limitations
- Currency-aware gift amount reporting

### Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration Model**: Uses XML to define report structure and behavior without requiring code changes
2. **Typed Parameter System**: Each configuration parameter has an ID and typed value attribute for proper data processing
3. **Dimensional Reporting**: Supports multiple calculation types across different data dimensions
4. **Integration with Partner Management**: Leverages OpenPetra's partner data model for report generation

The XML Subscription Report architecture aligns with OpenPetra's broader goals of reducing administrative overhead by providing configurable reporting capabilities that can be adapted to different organizational needs without programming expertise.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Subscription Report defining parameters, columns, and display settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the configuration parameters for the Subscription Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, and report display properties. The file configures nine display columns with their respective widths and calculation types, including Street Name, PostCode, City, Primary Phone, Address Type, Gift Amount, Gift Currency, Gift Recipient, and Gift Receiving Field. Additional parameters control partner selection, extraction criteria, ordering, and maximum column display. Each parameter has an ID attribute and a typed value attribute that determines how the data should be processed in the report generation system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file for report structure
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter controls the number of columns shown in the report
- `Line 15-29`: Column definitions use a combination of string identifiers and numeric width specifications with different data types (Integer vs Decimal)
