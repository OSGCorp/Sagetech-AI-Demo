# XML Partner By Relationship Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner By Relationship Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra that generates structured relationship data between partners in the system. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that extracts, formats, and presents partner relationship information according to predefined parameters. The report configuration is primarily driven through XML-based definitions that control data selection, filtering, and presentation layout.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner selection criteria with multiple filtering options
- Structured 8-column report layout with customizable column widths
- Relationship data extraction and formatting between different partner entities
- Support for active partner filtering, mailing address selection, and solicitation preferences

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Driven Configuration: The report structure and behavior are defined through XML configuration files, allowing for flexible customization without code changes
2. Parameterized Filtering: Advanced filtering capabilities enable precise selection of partner relationships based on multiple criteria
3. Structured Layout Definition: The 8-column layout system provides consistent presentation of partner keys, names, classes, and relationship information
4. Integration with Partner Data Model: The report interfaces directly with OpenPetra's core partner data structures to extract relationship information

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, where report behavior is defined in XML rather than code. This design promotes maintainability by separating report definition from implementation logic. The report integrates with OpenPetra's partner management system to provide relationship visibility across the organization. Engineers extending this component should focus on understanding the XML schema structure and the relationship data model to implement new features effectively.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for a Partner Relationship Report defining parameters and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Partner Relationship Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML data sources, report title, and display options. The file configures partner selection criteria including filters for active partners, mailing addresses, and solicitation preferences. It defines an 8-column report layout with column widths and calculation fields that display partner keys, names, classes, and relationship information between partners. The parameters control how relationship data is presented in the report output.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML files that contain the actual data structure for the report
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 8 columns
- `Line 7-13`: Partner selection parameters allow filtering by specific partner key or categories
- `Line 14-29`: Column definitions specify both content and width allocation in the report layout
