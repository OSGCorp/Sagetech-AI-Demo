# XML Publication Statistics Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Publication Statistics Report is a specialized reporting component within the OpenPetra system that generates statistical analyses of publication-related data. This subproject implements a configurable reporting framework that processes donor, participant, church, and applicant data related to publications, presenting it in a structured tabular format. The implementation leverages XML configuration to define report parameters, column structures, and display settings without requiring code changes.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-driven configuration system for report definition and customization
- Columnar data organization with configurable widths and display properties
- Statistical aggregation of publication-related metrics across different entity types
- Standardized report formatting with consistent display parameters
- Integration with OpenPetra's broader reporting infrastructure

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML configuration files to define report structure, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. **Entity-based Data Organization**: Structures data around key entity types (Counties, Donors, ExParticipants, Churches, Applicants)
3. **Dimensional Data Presentation**: Implements a multi-column approach to present related statistics in a comparative format
4. **Infrastructure Integration**: Operates within OpenPetra's reporting framework, leveraging common display and processing capabilities

## Architecture
The subproject follows a configuration-driven architecture where report definitions in XML determine data retrieval, processing logic, and presentation format. This approach separates the reporting logic from presentation concerns, enabling flexible report generation while maintaining consistent styling and structure across the OpenPetra platform.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for Publication Statistical Report settings in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the Publication Statistical Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, report name, and display configuration. The file sets up five columns for the report: County, Donors, ExParticipants, Churches, and Applicants, each with defined column widths. These parameters control how statistical data about publications is displayed and organized in the report interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'publicationstatisticalreport.xml' that likely contains the actual report definition
- `Line 5`: Sets maximum display columns to 5, limiting the report's horizontal display capacity
- `Line 6-14`: Defines column structure with specific width values stored as decimal representations
