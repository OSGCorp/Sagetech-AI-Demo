# XML Print Partner Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Print Partner Report is a specialized configuration component within the OpenPetra ecosystem that defines how partner information is formatted and presented in printed reports. This subproject implements the report definition framework and parameter configuration for partner-related data extraction, along with conditional display logic for various partner information sections. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner information display through XML-based parameter definitions
- Conditional rendering of partner data sections based on boolean flags
- Customizable report formatting with section visibility controls
- Structured data extraction from the partner management subsystem

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Configuration: Uses structured XML to define report parameters, enabling consistent and maintainable report definitions
2. Conditional Section Rendering: Implements boolean flags to control visibility of specific partner information sections
3. Hierarchical Data Organization: Structures partner data into logical sections (class data, interests, subscriptions, etc.)
4. Empty Section Handling: Provides configuration options to hide empty sections, improving report readability

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, allowing report customization without code changes. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both system-level settings and user-configurable parameters. The design separates content selection from presentation concerns, enabling flexible report generation while maintaining consistency. This subproject interfaces with OpenPetra's partner management and reporting systems to extract and format partner data according to the defined specifications.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the 'Print Partner' report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines default parameters for the 'Print Partner' report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, and various boolean flags controlling what information should be included in the partner printout. Parameters control the display of partner class data, interests, subscriptions, contacts, relationships, reminders, locations, finance details, contact details, and special types. Additional settings determine whether to hide empty sections and enable pagination.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'printpartner.xml' that likely contains the actual report definition
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter set to 0, which may indicate unlimited columns or special handling
- `Line 7-8`: Parameters indicate this report can work with either a single partner or an extract of partners
