# XML Valid Bank Account Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Valid Bank Account Report is a configuration-driven component within OpenPetra that provides structured validation reporting for bank account data. The subproject implements a specialized reporting mechanism that allows non-profit organizations to verify and audit their banking information through standardized output formats. This reporting module integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial management capabilities to ensure data integrity and compliance.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration framework for flexible report definition
- Structured column presentation with customizable widths and sorting preferences
- Partner-centric data organization with multiple classification dimensions
- Hierarchical data validation with reason code integration
- Parameterized report generation supporting financial compliance requirements

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, allowing report modifications without code changes
2. **Multi-dimensional Data Organization**: Data is structured around partner entities with class-based categorization for flexible reporting
3. **Hierarchical Sorting Logic**: Three-level sorting mechanism (Partner Class → Reason → Account Number) enables intuitive data presentation
4. **Parameterized Column Definition**: Column specifications include width constraints and display properties for consistent report formatting
5. **Integration with Partner Management**: The report leverages OpenPetra's partner management subsystem for contextual data enrichment

## Technical Implementation
The report configuration uses XML schema definitions to establish report parameters, column specifications, and sorting rules. This approach enables report customization while maintaining structural integrity across the application's reporting framework.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration for a Valid Bank Account Report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the configuration settings for the Valid Bank Account Report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, and report parameters including column definitions, widths, and sorting preferences. The file establishes five display columns showing Partner Key, Partner Class, Partner Name, Account Number, and Reason, with sorting configured by Partner Class, Reason, and Account Number. It also defines column widths and calculation parameters for data presentation in the report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Links to the validbankaccountreport.xml file that likely contains the actual report structure
- `Line 9-11`: Defines three-level sorting hierarchy for the report data
- `Line 13-14`: Maps sort columns to their numeric indices for processing
