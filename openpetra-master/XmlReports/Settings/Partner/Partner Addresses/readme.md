# XML Partner Addresses Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner Addresses Report is a configuration-driven component that generates standardized address listings for partners within the OpenPetra system. This subproject implements structured partner address reporting capabilities through XML-based configuration, providing a consistent interface for extracting and presenting contact information. The implementation leverages OpenPetra's reporting infrastructure to deliver formatted address data for administrative and operational purposes.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner address extraction with 11 distinct data columns
- Hierarchical data organization by partner class and address types
- Customizable display formatting including column widths and sorting preferences
- Address validity filtering based on date ranges
- Best address selection logic for partners with multiple addresses

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Driven Configuration: Report structure, parameters, and behavior are defined declaratively in XML, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. Standardized Column Definitions: Consistent data extraction through predefined calculation columns for partner information
3. Multi-level Sorting: Hierarchical data organization through configurable sort orders (Short Name, Address Type, Valid From date)
4. Parameter-Based Filtering: Support for runtime parameter passing to filter partner selection
5. Integration with Partner Data Model: Direct mapping to OpenPetra's underlying partner and address data structures

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, separating report definition from implementation logic. This design enables non-technical users to modify report behavior through configuration changes while maintaining consistency with OpenPetra's broader reporting framework. The report structure accommodates both detailed and summary views of partner address information, supporting various administrative and operational use cases within nonprofit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Partner Addresses report defining parameters, calculations, and column settings.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines the settings for the Partner Addresses report in OpenPetra. It specifies report parameters including XML source files, display settings, sorting preferences, and column configurations. The file defines 11 calculation columns including Partner Key, Partner Class, Partner Name, address fields (Street Name, Post Code, City, Country), Primary Phone, Field, Address Type, and Address valid from. It also specifies column widths and sorting order by Short Name, Address Type, and Address valid from date. The configuration supports partner selection and best address retrieval functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'partneraddressreport.xml' that likely contains the actual report template
- `Line 9-11`: Defines a three-level sorting hierarchy for the report data
- `Line 13`: Specifies 'GetBestAddressForPartner' as the address detail retrieval method
- `Line 14-32`: Uses decimal values encoded as scientific notation for column width specifications
