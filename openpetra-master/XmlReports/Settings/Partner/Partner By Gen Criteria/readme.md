# XML Partner By General Criteria Report

The XML Partner By General Criteria Report is a configurable reporting component within OpenPetra that enables filtering and extraction of partner data based on user-defined criteria. This subproject implements a standardized approach to partner data reporting through XML configuration templates.

## Key Technical Features

- **XML-based Configuration**: Uses structured XML templates to define report parameters and behavior
- **Configurable Boolean Flags**: Implements three primary control flags:
  - Active partner filtering
  - Mailing address selection
  - Solicitation-based exclusion
- **Template-driven Architecture**: Separates report definition from execution logic
- **Parameter Management**: Provides default values while allowing runtime overrides

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration**: The standard.xml file serves as a configuration contract between the reporting engine and the partner data subsystem
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between report definition (XML) and data processing logic
3. **Extensible Parameter System**: Designed to accommodate additional filtering criteria as requirements evolve
4. **Integration with Partner Subsystem**: Leverages OpenPetra's partner data model for consistent data access

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows OpenPetra's Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports architecture pattern, providing a standardized interface for report generation while maintaining flexibility through configuration. This approach enables developers to extend reporting capabilities without modifying core application code, supporting OpenPetra's mission to provide adaptable administrative tools for non-profit organizations.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for the Partner By General Criteria report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file configures default parameters for the Partner By General Criteria report in OpenPetra. It specifies four parameters: the XML file path for the report template, and three boolean flags that control report behavior - whether to include only active partners, only mailing addresses, and whether to exclude partners with no solicitations. These parameters provide the default configuration when users run this partner report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: References an external XML template file that contains the actual report definition
