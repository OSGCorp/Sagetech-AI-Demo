# XML Partner By Special Type Report Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner By Special Type Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates specialized partner listings based on partner types and classifications. This sub-project implements a declarative XML-based report definition system that enables flexible partner data extraction and presentation. The component provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable column definitions with customizable widths and calculation parameters
- Comprehensive partner data filtering based on multiple criteria
- Flexible sorting and organization of partner records
- Conditional display options for active/inactive partners and mailing addresses

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Driven Configuration: The report structure, columns, and behavior are defined through XML configuration files, allowing for modifications without code changes
2. Parameterized Filtering: The system supports multiple filtering options including partner status, address types, and solicitation preferences
3. Columnar Data Model: Nine standard display columns are defined with specific width and calculation parameters
4. Hierarchical Partner Classification: The report leverages OpenPetra's partner classification system to generate targeted listings

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, with the `standard.xml` file serving as the central definition point for report behavior. This design enables administrators to modify report outputs without developer intervention. The report integrates with OpenPetra's partner management system to extract and present partner data according to specialized business rules. The configuration supports fine-grained control over which partners appear in reports and how their information is presented, making it particularly valuable for organizations that need to segment their contact database for different operational purposes.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Partner By Special Type report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML configuration file defines parameters for the 'Partner By Special Type' report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, column configurations, sorting preferences, and filtering options. The file defines 9 display columns including Partner Key, Partner Class, Partner Name, address details, phone number, and Field. It sets column widths and calculation parameters for each column. Additional parameters control filtering options such as showing only active partners, mailing addresses, and excluding no-solicitation partners.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: System settings parameter enables global configuration access for the report
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits visible columns to 9 despite defining more columns
- `Line 10-11`: Address Type and valid-from date are used for sorting but not displayed in the report
- `Line 33-35`: Three boolean parameters control filtering of partners by active status, mailing addresses, and solicitation preferences
