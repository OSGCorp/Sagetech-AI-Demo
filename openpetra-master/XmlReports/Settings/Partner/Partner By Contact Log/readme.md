# XML Partner By Contact Log Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner By Contact Log Report is a specialized reporting component within OpenPetra's broader reporting infrastructure. This subproject implements a standardized mechanism for generating reports that detail partner contact log activities, providing a comprehensive view of interactions with partners across the organization. The implementation leverages OpenPetra's XML-based reporting framework to deliver consistent, configurable output formats.

## Key Technical Features

- Parameter-less Report Generation: Designed to function with minimal configuration requirements
- XML-driven Configuration: Uses declarative XML structure to define report behavior
- Integration with Partner Management System: Directly interfaces with OpenPetra's contact management database
- Standardized Output Formatting: Ensures consistent presentation of contact log data

## Identified Design Elements

1. Minimalist Configuration Approach: The standard.xml file employs an empty Parameters element, allowing the report to operate with system defaults
2. Infrastructure Layer Integration: Positioned within the Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports architecture layer
3. Extensible XML Schema: Built on OpenPetra's XML reporting framework for future parameter additions
4. Default Parameter Handling: Relies on the system's parameter resolution mechanism when specific parameters aren't provided

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's XML reporting paradigm, emphasizing simplicity and reusability. By leveraging the existing reporting infrastructure, this component maintains consistency with other system reports while focusing specifically on partner contact logs. The minimal configuration approach reduces maintenance overhead while still allowing for future extension of parameters if reporting requirements evolve.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML parameter file for Partner By Contact Log report in OpenPetra's XML reporting system.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file serves as a parameter configuration file for the 'Partner By Contact Log' report in OpenPetra's XML reporting system. The file contains an empty Parameters element, indicating that this particular report either requires no parameters or uses default parameters defined elsewhere in the system. This minimal configuration suggests the report may use system defaults or retrieve all partner contact log data without filtering options.
