# XML Local Partner Data Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Local Partner Data Report is a configuration-driven component that implements OpenPetra's partner data reporting capabilities. The subproject defines the structure, appearance, and behavior of partner data reports through XML configuration files, enabling non-profit organizations to extract and present partner information in standardized formats. This reporting module integrates with OpenPetra's broader contact management system, providing a configurable interface for generating partner data reports.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based configuration system for report definition
- Parameterized partner selection criteria for targeted reporting
- Configurable display columns with customizable widths
- Flexible sorting mechanisms for organized data presentation
- Partner categorization by label types and usage categories

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Report Configuration**: Uses XML to define report structure, separating report logic from application code
2. **Parameter-Driven Filtering**: Implements system settings and selection criteria to filter partner data
3. **Presentation Layer Controls**: Configures display columns, widths, and sorting preferences
4. **Partner Classification System**: Leverages label types and usage categories for targeted reporting
5. **Integration with Partner Data Sources**: References XML data source files to populate reports

## Architecture Overview
The XML Local Partner Data Report follows a configuration-as-code approach, where report definitions are externalized in XML files. This architecture promotes maintainability by allowing report modifications without code changes, supports extensibility through the addition of new parameters or columns, and enables consistent reporting across the OpenPetra platform through standardized configuration patterns.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for the Local Partner Data report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file configures the Local Partner Data report in OpenPetra's XML reporting system. It defines essential parameters including system settings, XML data source files, display columns, partner selection criteria, and sorting preferences. The file specifies two main display columns (Partner Name and Partner Key) with their respective widths, defines sorting order by Partner Name and Partner Key, and sets partner label types and usage categories. These parameters control how partner data is presented and organized in the generated report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data source file for partner data
- `Line 7`: Limits display columns to 2, controlling report layout
- `Line 14-15`: Defines readable sort order separate from technical column references
- `Line 23`: Specifies partner label types for report categorization
