# XML Supporting Churches Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Supporting Churches Report is a specialized configuration component within OpenPetra that generates formatted reports of supporting churches and related organizations. This subproject implements structured XML-based report definitions along with parameter configurations that drive the report generation process. It provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable partner information display with customizable columns
- Flexible sorting and filtering mechanisms for partner data
- Standardized report formatting with defined column widths and calculations
- Parameter-driven selection criteria for targeted reporting

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: Uses structured XML to define report parameters, ensuring consistency and maintainability
2. **Column-Based Data Presentation**: Configures seven distinct information columns with specific widths and calculation parameters
3. **Flexible Partner Data Filtering**: Implements selection criteria and partner key filtering for targeted reporting
4. **Standardized Sorting Mechanism**: Establishes default sorting by PartnerName with options for alternative sorting methods

## Overview
The architecture follows a declarative configuration approach, separating report definitions from the core application logic. The standard.xml file serves as the central configuration point, defining both the data source and presentation layer aspects of the report. This separation allows for easy modification of report parameters without changing application code. The report structure focuses on partner relationships and contact information, supporting OpenPetra's core mission of helping non-profit organizations manage their administrative relationships efficiently.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Supporting Churches report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file configures parameters for the Supporting Churches report in OpenPetra. It defines system settings, specifies the XML data source file, and establishes report display properties including column configurations. The file sets up seven display columns with their respective widths and calculation parameters, showing information such as Partner Key, Partner Name, Type/Relation, Field, Partner Address, Primary E-Mail, and Primary Phone. It also specifies sorting by PartnerName and includes parameters for selection criteria and partner key filtering.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file for data source using relative path notation
- `Line 7`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to 7 columns
- `Line 9`: Partner key parameter initialized to 0, likely serving as a default value
- `Line 10-22`: Column configuration uses a pattern of alternating calculation type and width parameters
