# XML Partner By City Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a .NET-based application that provides comprehensive administrative management for non-profit organizations. The system handles contact management, accounting, and data export functionalities. This sub-project implements XML-based reporting capabilities specifically for generating partner listings organized by city, along with configuration-driven report formatting and parameter handling.  This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Declarative report definition through XML configuration
- Structured partner data presentation with consistent formatting
- Parameterized filtering by city location
- Standardized column layout and sorting mechanisms

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Report Configuration: Uses structured XML to define report parameters, data sources, and display formats without requiring code changes
2. Columnar Data Organization: Implements specific column definitions with controlled widths for Partner Name, Partner Key, City, PostCode, and Partner Class
3. Multi-level Sorting Logic: Applies hierarchical sorting by City, Short Name, and Partner Key for intuitive data organization
4. Parameter-Driven Filtering: Supports dynamic report generation through configurable city-based filtering parameters

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-over-code approach, allowing report definitions to be maintained separately from application logic. The XML configuration structure provides a clear separation between data retrieval, presentation formatting, and sorting rules. This design enables non-technical users to adjust report layouts while maintaining consistent data presentation across the application. The sub-project integrates with OpenPetra's broader partner management capabilities while providing specialized city-based organizational views of partner data.

## Business Functions

### Report Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file for a Partner by City report defining parameters, columns, and sorting options.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines the configuration for the 'Partner by City' report in OpenPetra. It specifies report parameters including system settings, XML data source, column definitions, and sorting preferences. The file configures five display columns: Partner Name, Partner Key, City, PostCode, and Partner Class, each with specified column widths. It also establishes a sorting order by City, Short Name, and Partner Key, and includes parameters for filtering by city. This configuration supports OpenPetra's partner management reporting functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML data source file for the report content
- `Line 6`: Defines maximum display columns limit for the report layout
- `Line 10-12`: Establishes a three-level hierarchical sorting order for the report data
- `Line 14`: Links sort parameters to specific column numbers using param_sortby_columns
