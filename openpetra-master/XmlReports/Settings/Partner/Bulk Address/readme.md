# XML Bulk Address Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Bulk Address Report is a configuration-driven component that enables OpenPetra to generate standardized address reports for non-profit organizations. This subproject implements a structured reporting framework for partner address information extraction and presentation, providing these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Configurable column-based address data extraction
- Standardized partner information display with consistent formatting
- Ordered data presentation with partner key sequencing
- Flexible report generation for administrative and operational needs

## Identified Design Elements

1. **XML-Based Configuration**: The reporting structure is defined through XML configuration files that specify system settings, file paths, and column definitions
2. **Structured Column Definitions**: Eight standardized columns (Partner Key, Partner Name, Street Name, Post Code, City, Country, Copies, Subscription) with predefined widths and calculation parameters
3. **Calculation Parameters**: Each column has associated calculation logic that determines how data is processed and displayed
4. **Ordered Data Extraction**: The system implements partner data extraction with consistent ordering by partner key

## Overview
The architecture follows a configuration-first approach where report structure and behavior are externalized in XML files rather than hardcoded in the application. This design promotes maintainability by separating report definitions from application logic, allowing non-developers to modify report structures. The standard.xml file serves as the blueprint for address report generation, defining both the visual presentation and data extraction rules in a consistent format that integrates with OpenPetra's broader partner management capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a bulk address report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the 'Bulk Address' report in OpenPetra. It specifies system settings, XML file paths, and column definitions for displaying partner address information. The file configures eight display columns including Partner Key, Partner Name, Street Name, Post Code, City, Country, Copies, and Subscription. Each column has an assigned width value and calculation parameter. The configuration supports partner data extraction with ordering by partner key and provides structure for generating standardized address reports.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'bulkaddressreport.xml' that likely contains the actual report template
- `Line 6`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits the report to exactly 8 columns
- `Line 17`: Some column widths use decimal notation (4612811918334230528) rather than integer values
