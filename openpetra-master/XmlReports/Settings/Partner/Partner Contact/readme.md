# XML Partner Contact Report Subproject Of OpenPetra

The XML Partner Contact Report is a configuration-driven reporting component within OpenPetra that generates standardized views of partner contact information. This subproject implements report definition and rendering capabilities through XML configuration files, providing a structured approach to contact data presentation. The component transforms partner contact data into formatted reports with consistent styling and layout, supporting OpenPetra's broader contact management functionality.

## Key Technical Features

- XML-based report configuration for declarative report definition
- Structured column layout with 9 predefined data fields for contact information
- Parameter-driven filtering for partner selection and contact criteria
- Flexible display formatting options for consistent report presentation
- Integration with OpenPetra's partner data management system

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Uses XML schema to define report structure, parameters, and display options without code changes
2. **Parameterized Filtering**: Supports dynamic report generation based on user-selected criteria for partners and contacts
3. **Standardized Column Layout**: Implements a consistent presentation model with predefined columns (Contactor, Method, Contact ID, etc.)
4. **Calculation Support**: Enables computed values and conditional formatting within report columns
5. **Width Management**: Provides explicit control over column widths for optimal report layout

## Architecture

The report configuration resides in the Infrastructure.Configuration.Reports layer, serving as a bridge between the data model and presentation layer. It follows a template-based approach where the standard.xml file defines the report structure that the reporting engine uses to generate the final output.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `standard.xml` : XML configuration file defining parameters for a Partner Contact report in OpenPetra.

## Files
### standard.xml

This XML file defines configuration parameters for the Partner Contact report in OpenPetra. It specifies report settings including system parameters, XML source files, display options, and column configurations. The file sets up parameters for partner selection, contact filtering, and display formatting. It defines 9 columns for the report with their respective calculations and widths: Contactor, Method, Contact ID, Contact Date, Mailing, Notes, Contact Attribute, Contact Detail, and Contact Detail Description. These parameters control how partner contact information is presented in the generated report.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: References external XML file 'partnercontactreport.xml' that likely contains the actual report template
- `Line 7`: MaxDisplayColumns parameter limits display to 10 columns though 9 are defined
- `Line 9-11`: Parameters for filtering contacts by partner key and sorting by name
- `Line 12-14`: Wildcard filters (*) for contactor and contact selection
