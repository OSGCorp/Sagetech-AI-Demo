# Resources Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a free, open-source software system that helps non-profit organizations manage their operations. The Resources subproject provides the essential graphical assets and resource files that support the user interface and visual components throughout the application. This subproject primarily manages static content that enhances the user experience and maintains visual consistency across the platform.

The Resources subproject serves as a centralized repository for:

- Icon files and graphical elements used throughout the interface
- Visual indicators for navigation and user interaction
- UI components that maintain consistent branding and visual identity
- Licensed third-party visual assets properly attributed and documented

## Identified Design Elements

1. **License-Compliant Resource Management**: Careful documentation and attribution of third-party resources (like Nuvola icons) to ensure legal compliance
2. **Centralized Asset Repository**: Single source of truth for visual elements to maintain consistency across the application
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between functional code and visual resources
4. **Reusable Visual Components**: Common visual elements that can be referenced across multiple parts of the application

## Overview
The Resources architecture follows best practices for resource management in open-source projects, with proper attribution and licensing documentation. The organization emphasizes maintainability through centralization, allowing developers to easily locate and update visual assets. This approach supports the broader Petra application by providing a consistent visual language that enhances usability while ensuring compliance with open-source licensing requirements.

## Business Functions

### Documentation
- `license.txt` : License information for icon files used in OpenPetra from the Nuvola project.

## Files
### license.txt

This license file documents that specific icon files (2leftarrow.png, 2uparrow.png, 2downarrow.png) used in OpenPetra are sourced from the Nuvola project (http://www.icon-king.com/projects/nuvola/) and are licensed under the LGPL. The file serves as attribution and license compliance documentation for these graphical assets within the OpenPetra project.
