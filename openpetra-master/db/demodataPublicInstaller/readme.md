# Database Public Demo Data Installer

The Database Public Demo Data Installer is a critical sub-project of OpenPetra that manages the initialization and configuration of demonstration data for testing and evaluation purposes. This component provides essential database setup functionality through SQL scripts that configure the system for demonstration use.

## Key Technical Functions

- **User Account Configuration** - Automatically sets all non-anonymous user accounts to require password changes on first login
- **System Default Settings** - Establishes core system configuration parameters for the demonstration environment
- **Reporting Engine Configuration** - Configures OpenPetra to use its built-in XML Report engine rather than external reporting solutions

## Technical Architecture

The installer consists of SQL scripts that perform targeted database modifications to prepare a clean demonstration environment. These scripts operate at the database layer and establish the foundation for OpenPetra's functionality by:

- Setting security flags in user tables
- Inserting system configuration records
- Establishing default operational parameters

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a straightforward SQL-based approach that:

1. Targets specific system tables for configuration updates
2. Maintains security best practices by requiring password resets
3. Configures the reporting subsystem for standalone operation
4. Ensures consistent behavior across demonstration instances

This component serves as the foundation for OpenPetra demonstrations, enabling evaluators and developers to experience a properly configured system without manual setup steps.

## Business Functions

### Database Configuration
- `init.sql` : SQL script that initializes demo data by resetting user passwords and configuring XML reports usage.

## Files
### init.sql

This SQL script performs two essential configuration tasks for the OpenPetra demo data: 1) It updates all user accounts (except 'ANONYMOUS') to require password changes on next login by setting s_password_needs_change_l to true, and 2) It inserts a system default setting that configures OpenPetra to use its built-in XML Report engine rather than an external reporting engine.
