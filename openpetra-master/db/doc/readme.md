# Database Documentation Subproject Of OpenPetra

The Database Documentation subproject provides comprehensive documentation and schema visualization for OpenPetra's database structure. This component generates up-to-date documentation directly from the database schema, ensuring that developers always have accurate reference materials as the system evolves. The subproject implements automated schema extraction and documentation generation along with visual representation of database relationships. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated generation of database schema documentation
- Visual representation of table relationships and dependencies
- Searchable reference of database fields, types, and constraints
- Integration with the broader OpenPetra documentation system

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Schema Extraction Engine**: Directly queries database metadata to generate accurate documentation without manual intervention
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Visualizes foreign key relationships between tables to aid in understanding data flow
3. **Documentation Templates**: Standardized formats for presenting table structures, constraints, and relationships
4. **Version Control Integration**: Tracks schema changes over time to provide historical context for database evolution

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach that separates the concerns of schema extraction, documentation generation, and presentation. The system is designed to run both as a scheduled task to maintain up-to-date documentation and on-demand when developers need the latest information. Documentation is generated in multiple formats including HTML, PDF, and interactive web-based visualizations to serve different use cases. This subproject is particularly valuable for onboarding new developers and for maintaining consistency during database schema modifications.
