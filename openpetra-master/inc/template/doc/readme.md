# Include Template Documents Subproject Of Petra

The Include Template Documents subproject provides the HTML template infrastructure for OpenPetra's documentation generation system. This component is responsible for transforming structured error code data into human-readable reference documentation that follows consistent formatting and organizational principles. The templates serve as the presentation layer for automatically generated technical documentation, ensuring that error codes and their descriptions are accessible to developers and system administrators.

This subproject implements templating patterns for error code documentation along with placeholder structures for dynamic content insertion. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Standardized error code documentation format
- Consistent presentation of error metadata
- Structured organization of errors by module
- Support for different error categories (validation, non-critical, critical)
- Automated documentation generation via build tools

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Modular Documentation Structure**: Templates organize error codes by module, creating logical groupings that align with the application's architecture
2. **Standardized Error Code Format**: Enforces the module.number.category pattern for all error codes
3. **Metadata-Rich Documentation**: Templates include placeholders for comprehensive error information including short descriptions, full descriptions, and declaring classes
4. **Build Integration**: Works with the 'nant errorCodeDoc' tool to generate documentation as part of the build process

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes consistency in error reporting, provides clear categorization of different error types, and supports the development workflow through automated documentation generation. The templates are designed to be maintainable and extensible, allowing for additional error information to be incorporated as the application evolves. This documentation system helps developers understand and troubleshoot issues by providing a centralized reference for all error codes in the OpenPetra system.

## Business Functions

### Documentation
- `errorcodes.html` : Template HTML file for automatically generated documentation of OpenPetra error codes.

## Files
### errorcodes.html

This template HTML file provides the structure for automatically generated documentation of OpenPetra error codes. It explains the error code format consisting of module abbreviation, period, five-digit number, and category character (V for validation, N for non-critical, E for other errors). The template includes placeholders for tables of error codes organized by module, with each table containing columns for error code, short description, full description, category, and declaring class. The document is generated using the 'nant errorCodeDoc' tool.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 7`: Document is automatically generated by 'nant errorCodeDoc' tool
- `Line 28`: Template uses custom placeholder syntax with {#TABLES}, {##TABLE}, {#ROWS}, and {##ROW} for dynamic content generation
- `Line 12`: Error code structure follows a specific format with module abbreviation, period, unique five-digit number, and category character
