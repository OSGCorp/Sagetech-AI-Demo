# Include Template Source Subproject Of Petra

Include Template Source is a foundational component of the OpenPetra system that manages source code templates and assembly metadata definitions. This subproject provides standardized file templates and assembly configuration patterns that ensure consistency across the broader OpenPetra codebase. The templates establish uniform licensing, attribution, and metadata structures that are essential for maintaining the open-source integrity of the system.

The subproject implements two primary template types:
- Source code header templates with proper GNU GPL licensing notices
- .NET assembly metadata configuration templates

These templates provide these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Consistent copyright and licensing information across all source files
- Standardized assembly metadata for .NET components
- Placeholder-based customization for project-specific information
- Proper attribution maintenance for the open-source project

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Templated Metadata Generation**: Uses placeholder variables (${projectname}, ${projectversion}) that are dynamically replaced during build processes
2. **License Compliance Management**: Ensures all source files properly maintain the GNU GPL licensing requirements
3. **Assembly Identity Control**: Standardizes how .NET assemblies identify themselves within the larger application ecosystem
4. **Build Process Integration**: Templates are designed to be consumed by automated build tools that populate context-specific information

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes consistency in licensing and metadata across the OpenPetra system, supporting the open-source nature of the project while providing flexibility through placeholder-based customization. The templates ensure proper attribution is maintained while standardizing how components identify themselves within the broader application. This foundation supports OpenPetra's mission to provide free, open-source administrative software for non-profit organizations.

## Sub-Projects

### inc/template/src/ClientServerGlue

It handles financial operations, contact management, and organizational workflows through a service-oriented architecture. This sub-project implements the critical server-side web service generation templates along with the integration layer that connects client requests to server-side business logic. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated SOAP web service endpoint generation for all modules
- Session management and authentication integration
- Permission verification through TModuleAccessManager
- Standardized error handling and logging

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based Code Generation**: The ServerGlue.cs template is processed by build tools to generate consistent web service implementations across all OpenPetra modules
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Each top-level module receives its own WebService class with standardized method signatures
3. **Security Integration**: Built-in permission checking is woven into all generated endpoints
4. **Error Management**: Consistent exception handling and logging patterns are applied across all generated services

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes maintainability through automated code generation, ensuring consistent implementation patterns across all modules. The integration layer provides a clean separation between the client-facing interfaces and the core business logic. This design allows for centralized security enforcement while maintaining modularity. The template-based approach reduces manual coding errors and ensures that best practices are consistently applied throughout the codebase, making it easier to extend functionality while maintaining architectural integrity.

### inc/template/src/ORM

The program implements database access patterns and object-relational mapping to provide a robust data layer. This sub-project implements code generation templates for ORM classes along with caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Strongly-typed data access through auto-generated classes
- Efficient data caching for frequently accessed but rarely changed tables
- Comprehensive CRUD operations with referential integrity enforcement
- Data validation before database operations

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based Code Generation**: Uses template files to generate strongly-typed data access classes, ensuring consistency across the ORM layer
2. **Caching Architecture**: Implements thread-static caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data tables to improve performance
3. **Cascading Operations**: Manages referential integrity through cascading delete verification and reference counting
4. **Type-Safe Data Access**: Generates strongly-typed properties and methods for database columns, providing compile-time type checking

#### Overview
The architecture follows the Table Access Object pattern, providing a clean separation between database tables and business logic. The templates generate classes for tables, rows, datasets, and data access methods, ensuring consistent implementation across the system. The caching mechanism optimizes performance for frequently accessed data while maintaining data integrity. Validation classes enforce data integrity rules before database operations, and cascading operations ensure referential integrity is maintained across related tables. The generated code supports both traditional database access and web-based API interactions.

## Business Functions

### Documentation Templates
- `EmptyFileComment.txt` : Template file containing standard copyright header for OpenPetra source files.

### Build Configuration
- `AssemblyInfo.cs` : Assembly information file for OpenPetra project defining metadata attributes for .NET assemblies.

## Files
### AssemblyInfo.cs

This file defines assembly attributes for OpenPetra .NET components. It sets metadata properties like title, company, copyright, and version information that are embedded in the compiled assembly. The file serves as a template with placeholders (${projectname}, ${projectversion}) that are replaced during the build process. Key attributes include AssemblyTitle, AssemblyCompany, AssemblyCopyright, ComVisible, and AssemblyVersion, providing identity and versioning information for the assembly.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 6-7`: Uses template variables (${projectname}, ${projectversion}) that get replaced during build process
- `Line 11`: Copyright notice indicates OM International ownership from 2004-2018
- `Line 14`: ComVisible(false) attribute prevents COM components from accessing the assembly types
### EmptyFileComment.txt

This template file provides the standard copyright header that should be included at the beginning of all OpenPetra source code files. It contains the GNU General Public License notice, indicating that OpenPetra is free software that can be redistributed and modified under specific terms. The template includes placeholders for author names and maintains copyright attribution to OM International.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4-5`: Placeholder for developers to add their names when creating new files
