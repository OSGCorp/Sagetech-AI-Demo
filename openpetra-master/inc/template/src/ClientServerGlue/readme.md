# Include Template Client Server Glue Source Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a .NET-based application that provides comprehensive administrative management for non-profit organizations. It handles financial operations, contact management, and organizational workflows through a service-oriented architecture. This sub-project implements the critical server-side web service generation templates along with the integration layer that connects client requests to server-side business logic. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated SOAP web service endpoint generation for all modules
- Session management and authentication integration
- Permission verification through TModuleAccessManager
- Standardized error handling and logging

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based Code Generation**: The ServerGlue.cs template is processed by build tools to generate consistent web service implementations across all OpenPetra modules
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Each top-level module receives its own WebService class with standardized method signatures
3. **Security Integration**: Built-in permission checking is woven into all generated endpoints
4. **Error Management**: Consistent exception handling and logging patterns are applied across all generated services

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes maintainability through automated code generation, ensuring consistent implementation patterns across all modules. The integration layer provides a clean separation between the client-facing interfaces and the core business logic. This design allows for centralized security enforcement while maintaining modularity. The template-based approach reduces manual coding errors and ensures that best practices are consistently applied throughout the codebase, making it easier to extend functionality while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Business Functions

### Integration Layer
- `ServerGlue.cs` : Auto-generated server-side web service glue code for OpenPetra's module system

## Files
### ServerGlue.cs

ServerGlue.cs is a template file used to generate server-side web service implementations for OpenPetra modules. It creates a WebService class for each top-level module that exposes methods as SOAP web services. The template includes placeholders for namespace imports, web connector methods, and permission checking. Each generated web service handles session management, error logging, and user permission verification through TModuleAccessManager. The file is designed to be processed by a build tool and not modified manually.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Creates a new TOpenPetraOrgSessionManager instance for each HTTP request to manage user sessions
- `Line 55`: Template uses placeholders like {#WEBCONNECTOR} and {#CHECKUSERMODULEPERMISSIONS} that get replaced during code generation
- `Line 67`: Generic exception handling wraps all web service calls to prevent exposing implementation details to clients
