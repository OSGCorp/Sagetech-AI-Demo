# Include Templates Subproject Of OpenPetra

Include Templates is a templating subsystem within OpenPetra that provides a flexible framework for generating and rendering user interface components. This C# implementation serves as the presentation layer for both web-based interfaces and API responses. The subsystem implements a modular approach to UI generation with template inheritance and partial view composition, enabling consistent styling and behavior across the application.

The Include Templates subsystem provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Dynamic template rendering with support for multiple output formats (HTML, JSON)
- Reusable UI components through partial views and widgets
- Consistent styling via integrated Bootstrap framework
- Form generation with automatic validation based on data models
- Internationalization support for multilingual interfaces

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template Inheritance System**: Base templates define layout structures that can be extended by child templates, promoting consistency and reducing duplication
2. **Partial View Architecture**: Complex UI components are composed from smaller, reusable partial views that can be independently maintained
3. **Format-Agnostic Controllers**: Controllers can render responses in multiple formats (HTML/JSON) based on request parameters
4. **Data Binding Framework**: Automatic binding between UI elements and data models with type validation
5. **Widget Library**: Pre-built UI components for common interface elements like forms, tables, and navigation

## Overview
The architecture follows MVC principles with a clear separation between data models, view templates, and controller logic. Templates are organized hierarchically with master layouts defining common structure and child templates providing specific content. The subsystem handles both synchronous page rendering and asynchronous partial updates through AJAX, supporting modern single-page application patterns while maintaining compatibility with traditional web interfaces.
