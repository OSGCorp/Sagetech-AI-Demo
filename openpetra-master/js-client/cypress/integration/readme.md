# JavaScript Client Integration Of Petra

The Petra application is a JavaScript-based system that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program integrates web-based user interfaces with backend services and implements comprehensive testing to ensure reliability. This sub-project implements client-side integration testing using Cypress along with partner management functionality testing.  This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Automated validation of login functionality
- End-to-end testing of partner data management
- Verification of form interactions and state changes
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Authentication Testing Framework**: Tests validate both case-sensitive and case-insensitive login scenarios, ensuring the authentication system works correctly across different user inputs
2. **Partner Data Management Workflow**: Comprehensive testing of the complete partner editing lifecycle, from search to modification to verification
3. **Asynchronous Operation Handling**: Implementation of route aliases and wait commands to properly test operations that involve server communication
4. **State Restoration**: Tests include cleanup procedures that return the system to its original state after testing, ensuring test isolation

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes thorough validation of user workflows through automated tests that simulate real user interactions. The Cypress-based testing framework provides reliable verification of both successful and failure paths, with particular attention to edge cases like case sensitivity in credentials. The tests are designed to be maintainable and readable, with clear assertions and comprehensive coverage of the application's core functionality, particularly focusing on authentication and partner data management.

## Business Functions

### Testing
- `login_spec.js` : Cypress test suite for OpenPetra login functionality with success and failure scenarios.
- `partner_edit.js` : Cypress test for partner editing functionality in OpenPetra's partner management module.

## Files
### login_spec.js

This Cypress test file implements automated tests for the OpenPetra login functionality. It contains three test cases: successful login with lowercase username 'demo', successful login with uppercase username 'DEMO', and failed login with incorrect password. Each test simulates user interactions with the login form, including typing credentials, clicking the login button, and verifying expected behaviors like successful navigation to the user dropdown menu or error message display for failed attempts.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 7`: Uses Cypress route interception to monitor API calls to the Login endpoint
- `Line 10`: Implements wait for asynchronous API response before continuing test execution
- `Line 12`: Uses explicit wait time (500ms) to handle UI animation before interacting with dropdown elements
### partner_edit.js

This Cypress test file validates the partner editing functionality in OpenPetra's partner management module. It tests a complete workflow of logging in, searching for a partner, editing their personal information (first name and email), handling consent modals, toggling solicitation preferences, saving changes, and verifying the changes were successfully applied. The test then reverts the changes to restore the original state. The file demonstrates how to interact with form elements, handle asynchronous operations using route aliases and wait commands, and verify UI state changes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 13`: Uses cy.route() to intercept API calls, allowing verification of network requests during testing
- `Line 25`: Tests partner search functionality by entering partial name and verifying results
- `Line 36`: Handles a consent modal that appears when changing contact information
- `Line 46`: Verifies success messages after saving partner data to ensure operations completed successfully
- `Line 50`: Implements a complete round-trip test by reverting changes to restore original state
