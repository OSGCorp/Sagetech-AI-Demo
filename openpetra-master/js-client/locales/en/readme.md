# JavaScript Client English Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a comprehensive open-source system designed for non-profit organizations to manage administration tasks efficiently. The JavaScript Client English subproject provides the English language localization resources for the client-side JavaScript components of the OpenPetra application. This subproject implements the text resources and translations needed for the user interface, along with error messages and descriptive content for the web client. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete English language support for all user-facing elements
- Consistent terminology across the application's modules
- Localized error messages and validation feedback
- Module-specific terminology for specialized non-profit operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Translation Organization**: Translations are organized into logical sections (login, navigation, forms, errors) enabling modular maintenance and updates
2. **Module-Specific Terminology Support**: Specialized vocabulary for partner management, finance, and system administration ensures domain-appropriate language
3. **Comprehensive UI Coverage**: Translations cover all interface elements including labels, buttons, messages, and form fields
4. **Non-Profit Domain Language**: Specialized terminology for donations, sponsorships, and memberships supports the application's core functionality

## Overview
The architecture of this subproject follows a structured JSON-based approach to localization, ensuring consistent terminology throughout the application. The translations are organized to align with the application's functional modules, supporting both general interface elements and specialized non-profit operations terminology. This design facilitates maintenance and extension of the language resources as new features are added to the application, while maintaining linguistic consistency across the user experience.

## Business Functions

### Localization
- `common.json` : Localization file containing English translations for OpenPetra's user interface elements, organized by functional areas.

## Files
### common.json

This JSON file contains English language translations for the OpenPetra application's user interface. It organizes translations into logical sections including login, navigation, forms, errors, and various module-specific sections like partner management, finance, and system administration. The file provides translations for labels, buttons, messages, form fields, and descriptive text throughout the application. Key sections include authentication flows, partner/contact management, financial operations (GL batches, gift batches), reporting, and system configuration. The translations support both general interface elements and specialized terminology for non-profit operations like donations, sponsorships, and memberships.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Comprehensive localization file organized by functional modules rather than alphabetically, making maintenance easier by context
- `Line 23`: Contains HTML markup within translation strings, allowing for rich text in UI elements
- `Line 1123`: Implements a hierarchical structure for translations that mirrors the application's module organization
