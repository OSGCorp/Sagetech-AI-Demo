# JavaScript Client Locales Subproject Of Petra

The Petra is a web-based application that provides non-profit organizations with comprehensive administrative and financial management capabilities. The program handles internationalization requirements and delivers localized user experiences across multiple languages. This sub-project implements the localization framework for the JavaScript client interface along with language-specific translation resources. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic language switching without page reloads
- Consistent terminology across the application interface
- Localized error messages and validation feedback
- Culture-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies

## Identified Design Elements

1. JSON-based Translation Storage: Structured hierarchical organization of translation strings enables efficient lookup and maintenance
2. Modular Organization: Translations are organized by functional areas (login, navigation, forms, etc.) for better maintainability
3. Comprehensive Coverage: Includes translations for all UI elements from buttons and labels to complex error messages
4. Functional Domain Separation: Distinct translation sections for partner management, financial operations, gift processing, and system administration

## Overview
The architecture follows a key-value approach with nested JSON objects representing the application's structure. German translations demonstrate the implementation pattern that can be extended to other languages. The localization system supports OpenPetra's core features including contact management, accounting, sponsorship management, and reporting functions. The translation files are designed to be maintainable by non-developers, allowing for community contributions to language support while maintaining technical consistency in the application.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/locales/de-DE

The JavaScript Client German subproject provides German language localization for the web client interface, enabling German-speaking users to interact with the system in their native language. This subproject is a critical component of Petra's internationalization strategy, making the application accessible to German-speaking organizations.

The subproject consists primarily of translation resources organized in a structured JSON format that maps UI elements, system messages, and functional terminology to their German equivalents. The translations cover:

- User authentication and session management
- Partner and contact management interfaces
- Financial operations and accounting terminology
- Reporting system labels and descriptions
- System configuration options
- Specialized module terminology (gifts, sponsorships, etc.)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Localization Hierarchy**: Translations are organized in logical sections that mirror the application's architecture, facilitating maintenance and updates
2. **Comprehensive UI Coverage**: Includes translations for all interactive elements including forms, navigation, buttons, and system messages
3. **Module-Specific Terminology**: Contains specialized vocabulary for financial, partner management, and sponsorship modules
4. **Error Handling Localization**: Provides German translations for system errors and validation messages

#### Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices with clear key-value mappings that can be loaded dynamically by the application. The translation structure maintains consistency with other language implementations while addressing German-specific linguistic requirements. Engineers implementing new features should extend the translation file with appropriate German text for any new UI elements or system messages.

### js-client/locales/nb-NO

The program handles contact management and accounting operations while supporting international financial transactions. This sub-project implements Norwegian (nb-NO) language localization for the JavaScript client interface, providing culturally appropriate translations for all user-facing elements of the OpenPetra system.  This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete Norwegian language support across the entire application interface
- Culturally appropriate translations for specialized financial and administrative terminology
- Localized error messages and system notifications
- Region-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currency values

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Translation Organization**: Translations are organized in a hierarchical JSON structure that mirrors the application's component architecture
2. **Module-Specific Terminology**: Contains specialized vocabulary for partner management, general ledger, gift processing, and other functional areas
3. **UI Element Coverage**: Provides translations for all interface components including menus, forms, buttons, and system messages
4. **Internationalization Support**: Works within the application's i18n framework to deliver a consistent Norwegian user experience

#### Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices by separating content from presentation, enabling Norwegian-speaking users to access the full functionality of OpenPetra. The translation file is structured to facilitate maintenance and updates as the application evolves. This localization layer ensures that Norwegian users can effectively utilize all features of the system while maintaining semantic accuracy in financial, administrative, and technical terminology.

### js-client/locales/en

The JavaScript Client English subproject provides the English language localization resources for the client-side JavaScript components of the OpenPetra application. This subproject implements the text resources and translations needed for the user interface, along with error messages and descriptive content for the web client. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete English language support for all user-facing elements
- Consistent terminology across the application's modules
- Localized error messages and validation feedback
- Module-specific terminology for specialized non-profit operations

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Translation Organization**: Translations are organized into logical sections (login, navigation, forms, errors) enabling modular maintenance and updates
2. **Module-Specific Terminology Support**: Specialized vocabulary for partner management, finance, and system administration ensures domain-appropriate language
3. **Comprehensive UI Coverage**: Translations cover all interface elements including labels, buttons, messages, and form fields
4. **Non-Profit Domain Language**: Specialized terminology for donations, sponsorships, and memberships supports the application's core functionality

#### Overview
The architecture of this subproject follows a structured JSON-based approach to localization, ensuring consistent terminology throughout the application. The translations are organized to align with the application's functional modules, supporting both general interface elements and specialized non-profit operations terminology. This design facilitates maintenance and extension of the language resources as new features are added to the application, while maintaining linguistic consistency across the user experience.

## Business Functions

### Localization
- `de/common.json` : German language translation file for OpenPetra's client interface, providing localized text for all UI elements.

## Files
### de/common.json

This file contains German language translations for OpenPetra's JavaScript client interface. It organizes translations in a hierarchical JSON structure with sections for login, navigation, forms, errors, constants, and various functional modules. The file provides German text for all user interface elements including buttons, labels, error messages, and form fields. Key sections include translations for partner management, financial operations, gift processing, ledger management, and system administration. The file ensures German-speaking users can interact with OpenPetra's features like contact management, accounting, sponsorship management, and reporting in their native language.
