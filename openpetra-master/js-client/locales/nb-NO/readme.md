# JavaScript Client Norwegian Of Petra

The Petra is a web-based application that provides comprehensive administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles contact management and accounting operations while supporting international financial transactions. This sub-project implements Norwegian (nb-NO) language localization for the JavaScript client interface, providing culturally appropriate translations for all user-facing elements of the OpenPetra system.  This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete Norwegian language support across the entire application interface
- Culturally appropriate translations for specialized financial and administrative terminology
- Localized error messages and system notifications
- Region-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currency values

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Translation Organization**: Translations are organized in a hierarchical JSON structure that mirrors the application's component architecture
2. **Module-Specific Terminology**: Contains specialized vocabulary for partner management, general ledger, gift processing, and other functional areas
3. **UI Element Coverage**: Provides translations for all interface components including menus, forms, buttons, and system messages
4. **Internationalization Support**: Works within the application's i18n framework to deliver a consistent Norwegian user experience

## Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices by separating content from presentation, enabling Norwegian-speaking users to access the full functionality of OpenPetra. The translation file is structured to facilitate maintenance and updates as the application evolves. This localization layer ensures that Norwegian users can effectively utilize all features of the system while maintaining semantic accuracy in financial, administrative, and technical terminology.

## Business Functions

### Localization
- `common.json` : Norwegian language localization file containing translations for OpenPetra's user interface elements.

## Files
### common.json

This JSON file provides Norwegian (nb-NO) translations for OpenPetra's user interface. It contains localized text for login screens, navigation menus, form elements, error messages, and various application modules. The translations cover system functionality including partner management, general ledger operations, gift processing, reporting, user administration, and system settings. The file is organized into logical sections that correspond to different parts of the application interface, making it easy for developers to locate and update specific translations as needed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Comprehensive localization file organized by functional areas of the application
- `Line 5`: Login section includes special messaging for demo instances and password recovery flows
- `Line 33`: Navigation section maps all application routes and menu items to Norwegian equivalents
- `Line 115`: Form controls and common UI elements translated for consistent Norwegian terminology
