## JavaScript Client German Subproject Of Petra

The Petra application is a comprehensive open-source system designed for non-profit organizations to manage administrative tasks. The JavaScript Client German subproject provides German language localization for the web client interface, enabling German-speaking users to interact with the system in their native language. This subproject is a critical component of Petra's internationalization strategy, making the application accessible to German-speaking organizations.

The subproject consists primarily of translation resources organized in a structured JSON format that maps UI elements, system messages, and functional terminology to their German equivalents. The translations cover:

- User authentication and session management
- Partner and contact management interfaces
- Financial operations and accounting terminology
- Reporting system labels and descriptions
- System configuration options
- Specialized module terminology (gifts, sponsorships, etc.)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Localization Hierarchy**: Translations are organized in logical sections that mirror the application's architecture, facilitating maintenance and updates
2. **Comprehensive UI Coverage**: Includes translations for all interactive elements including forms, navigation, buttons, and system messages
3. **Module-Specific Terminology**: Contains specialized vocabulary for financial, partner management, and sponsorship modules
4. **Error Handling Localization**: Provides German translations for system errors and validation messages

## Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices with clear key-value mappings that can be loaded dynamically by the application. The translation structure maintains consistency with other language implementations while addressing German-specific linguistic requirements. Engineers implementing new features should extend the translation file with appropriate German text for any new UI elements or system messages.

## Business Functions

### Localization
- `common.json` : German language translation file for OpenPetra's web client interface.

## Files
