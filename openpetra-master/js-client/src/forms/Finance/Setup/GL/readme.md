# JavaScript Client GL Setup Of Petra

The Petra is a web application that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks including finance and accounting operations. This sub-project implements the client-side JavaScript functionality for General Ledger (GL) setup operations along with the corresponding HTML templates. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Account hierarchy management through tree-based interfaces
- Cost center hierarchy visualization and manipulation
- YAML-based import/export functionality for finance structures
- Client-side processing of financial organizational elements

## Identified Design Elements

1. Tree-Based Visualization: Both account and cost center hierarchies are represented as navigable tree structures in the user interface
2. Server Communication: The JavaScript components make API calls to TGLSetupWebConnector methods to retrieve and update financial data
3. File Processing: Client-side handling of YAML files for importing and exporting hierarchical financial structures
4. Modular Architecture: Separation of HTML templates and JavaScript functionality with clear responsibilities
5. User Feedback: Comprehensive error handling and success notifications for all operations

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation templates and functional JavaScript code. The Account Tree and Cost Center Tree components share similar patterns, with each providing load, import, and export capabilities. The code interacts with server-side connectors while handling file operations through the browser's File API. The templates provide a consistent interface using Bootstrap styling, with modal dialogs for user interaction and feedback. This modular approach allows for maintainable code and extensible financial structure management.

## Business Functions

### Finance Management
- `CostCenterTree.html` : HTML template for the Cost Center Tree interface in OpenPetra's finance module.
- `CostCenterTree.js` : JavaScript client module for managing cost center hierarchy in OpenPetra's finance system.
- `AccountTree.js` : JavaScript module for managing account hierarchy in OpenPetra's finance module with import/export functionality.
- `AccountTree.html` : HTML template for the GL Account Tree interface with import/export functionality.

## Files
### AccountTree.html

This HTML template defines the interface for the GL Account Tree in the Finance Setup module. It provides a container for displaying account hierarchies with export and import functionality. The file includes buttons for exporting and importing data, with hidden file input for imports. It also contains a container for displaying the account tree structure and includes utility JavaScript files for supporting functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 13`: Hidden file input element triggered by a visible button for better UI experience when importing files
- `Line 16`: Container with 'container-list' class likely serves as the mount point for dynamically generated account tree structure
- `Line 21-22`: References to external JavaScript utilities that provide core functionality for the template
### AccountTree.js

This file implements functionality for managing account hierarchies in the Finance module of OpenPetra. It provides three main functions: LoadTree() to display the current account hierarchy structure, import_file() to upload and process YAML-formatted account hierarchy files, and export_file() to download the current account hierarchy as a YAML file. The code interacts with the server through API calls to TGLSetupWebConnector methods, handling both successful operations and errors with appropriate user feedback. The implementation includes security measures for file handling and uses the current ledger from local storage.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 37`: Uses HTML injection to render server-generated HTML code directly into the DOM
- `Line 51`: Implements browser feature detection for File APIs before attempting file operations
- `Line 59`: Security measure replacing < and > characters to prevent XSS attacks during file import
- `Line 93`: Creates and programmatically triggers a temporary download link for exporting files
### CostCenterTree.html

This HTML template defines the Cost Center Tree interface for OpenPetra's finance module. It provides a simple structure with export and import functionality for cost center data. The template includes a header with the page caption, a phantom storage div, a modal space, and a container with buttons for exporting and importing files. It references utility scripts for handling the functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 2`: Uses a phantom hidden div that likely serves as a template container for dynamic content generation
- `Line 14`: Implements file import/export functionality with a hidden file input that triggers on button click
- `Line 24`: References external utility scripts that handle the template's functionality
### CostCenterTree.js

This file implements client-side functionality for managing cost center hierarchies in OpenPetra's finance system. It provides functions to load, import, and export cost center hierarchies. The main functions include LoadTree() which retrieves and displays the cost center hierarchy from the server, import_file() which handles uploading and processing YAML hierarchy files, and export_file() which downloads the hierarchy as a YAML file. The code uses API calls to communicate with the server and handles file operations using the File API.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 37`: Uses HTML5 File APIs with compatibility check for browser support
- `Line 54`: Security implementation that replaces angle brackets to prevent XSS attacks when importing files
- `Line 83`: Creates and programmatically triggers a temporary download link for exporting files
