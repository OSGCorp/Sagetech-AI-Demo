## JavaScript Client Ledger Information Subproject Of Petra

The Petra is a web-based application that provides financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles accounting data and presents financial information through a browser interface. This sub-project implements client-side ledger information retrieval and display functionality along with template-based rendering of financial data. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic retrieval and display of general ledger information
- Real-time presentation of accounting period data
- Client-side template population with financial data
- Integration with the broader finance management module

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based Rendering**: The architecture separates HTML templates (LedgerInfo.html) from JavaScript functionality (LedgerInfo.js) to maintain clean separation of concerns
2. **Multiple API Integration**: The JavaScript component orchestrates multiple backend API calls to assemble a complete view of ledger information
3. **Local Storage Utilization**: Current ledger context is maintained through browser local storage, allowing for persistent user sessions
4. **Bootstrap Grid Implementation**: The presentation layer leverages Bootstrap's responsive grid system for consistent layout across devices

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation templates and functional logic. The HTML template defines the structure using Bootstrap's grid system with placeholder variables, while the JavaScript component handles API communication, data retrieval, and template population. The system retrieves ledger details, posting range dates, and period information through separate API calls, then assembles this data into a cohesive view for financial administrators. This modular approach allows for maintainable code and clear extension points for future financial reporting capabilities.

## Business Functions

### Finance Management
- `LedgerInfo.html` : HTML template for displaying ledger information in OpenPetra's finance module
- `LedgerInfo.js` : Displays ledger information including current period, posting range, and period dates in the Finance module.

## Files
### LedgerInfo.html

This HTML template file defines the layout for displaying general ledger information in the OpenPetra finance module. It structures information about a ledger including its name, number, base currency, accounting periods, and data retention settings. The template contains placeholder variables (enclosed in curly braces) that will be populated with actual ledger data when rendered. The layout is organized into sections using Bootstrap's grid system with rows and columns, and includes sections for current period information and forward posting periods. The file references external JavaScript libraries for utilities and templating functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses a 'phantom hidden' div to define template sections that may be conditionally displayed elsewhere in the document
- `Line 86`: Empty div elements with class 'period' and 'fwd_posting' likely serve as containers for dynamic content insertion via JavaScript
- `Line 101`: References external utility and templating libraries that handle the dynamic population of the template variables
### LedgerInfo.js

LedgerInfo.js implements a client-side script that retrieves and displays general ledger information in the OpenPetra Finance module. It makes three API calls to fetch ledger details, current posting range dates, and current period dates. The script then populates HTML templates with this data using the format_tpl function. The implementation uses jQuery to manipulate DOM elements and displays information such as the current period month, forward posting dates, and period dates. The code executes when the document is ready, retrieving the current ledger number from local storage.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 26`: Uses window.localStorage to retrieve the current ledger number for API calls
- `Line 29`: Implements i18next internationalization for month names
- `Line 30`: Uses format_tpl helper function to populate HTML templates with data
