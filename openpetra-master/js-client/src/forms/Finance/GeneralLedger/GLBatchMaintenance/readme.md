# JavaScript Client GL Batch Maintenance of Petra

The Petra application is a JavaScript-based financial management system that provides comprehensive general ledger functionality for non-profit organizations. This sub-project implements the client-side interface and logic for General Ledger batch maintenance, enabling users to create, manage, and process financial transactions efficiently. The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation templates and functional JavaScript code.

This sub-project provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete GL batch lifecycle management (creation, editing, posting, canceling, reversing)
- Transaction-level operations (adding, editing, importing/exporting)
- Advanced filtering by fiscal year, period, and batch status
- Interactive account and cost center selection with autocomplete functionality

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Logic Separation**: Clear division between HTML presentation (GLBatches.html) and functional logic (GLBatches.js)
2. **Modal Dialog Architecture**: Uses modal interfaces for batch and transaction editing operations
3. **Hierarchical Data Management**: Organizes financial data in a batch â†’ transaction hierarchy
4. **Filtering Framework**: Implements comprehensive filtering capabilities for efficient data navigation
5. **Import/Export Functionality**: Supports data interchange through standardized import/export operations

## Overview
The architecture employs modern JavaScript patterns to create a responsive financial management interface. The presentation layer leverages HTML templates with embedded placeholders for dynamic content, while the JavaScript layer handles data operations, user interactions, and server communication. The design emphasizes usability for financial operations while maintaining the flexibility needed for non-profit accounting requirements.

## Business Functions

### GL Batch Maintenance
- `GLBatches.html` : HTML template for GL batch maintenance interface with transaction management functionality.
- `GLBatches.js` : JavaScript client for managing General Ledger batches with transaction operations including creation, editing, posting, and importing/exporting.

## Files
### GLBatches.html

This HTML file implements the General Ledger Batch Maintenance interface for OpenPetra's finance module. It provides functionality for creating, viewing, editing, and managing GL batches and their transactions. The interface includes features for batch operations (posting, canceling, reversing), transaction management (adding, editing, importing/exporting), and filtering batches by year, period, and status. The template contains multiple sections including a batch listing area, transaction details, modal dialogs for editing batches and transactions, and a filter panel. It leverages autocomplete functionality for account and cost center selection.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Dynamic transaction management with collapsible sections for each batch
- `Line 36`: Conditional UI elements that show/hide based on batch posting status
- `Line 52`: CSV import functionality with inline example format and instructions
- `Line 245`: Autocomplete implementation for account and cost center selection
- `Line 321`: Filter system with year-dependent period selection
### GLBatches.js

This file implements the client-side functionality for the GL Batch Maintenance module in OpenPetra's finance system. It handles loading, displaying, creating, editing, and managing general ledger batches and their transactions. Key functionality includes filtering batches by year/period/status, viewing transaction details, creating/editing batches and transactions, importing/exporting transactions, and performing batch operations like posting, canceling, and reversing. Important functions include display_list(), updateBatch(), open_transactions(), new_batch(), edit_batch(), save_edit_batch(), save_edit_trans(), importTransactions(), exportTransactions(), batch_post(), batch_cancel(), and batch_reverse().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 26`: Uses local storage to persist user filter preferences between sessions
- `Line 56`: Implements dynamic loading of financial periods based on selected year
- `Line 151`: Handles conditional UI display based on batch status (posted vs unposted)
- `Line 270`: Implements transaction amount handling with debit/credit indicators for proper financial recording
- `Line 337`: Supports CSV import of transactions with configurable format parameters
