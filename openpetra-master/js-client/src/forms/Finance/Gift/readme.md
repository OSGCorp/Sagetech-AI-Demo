# JavaScript Client Gift Of Petra

The Petra JavaScript Client Gift module is a front-end component that handles gift processing and donation management within the OpenPetra ecosystem. Built with modern JavaScript frameworks, this subproject implements the user interface for gift entry, processing, and reporting, along with batch management capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Gift data entry and validation
- Batch processing of donations and contributions
- Donor management interface
- Gift receipt generation and management
- Reporting and analytics for donation tracking

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Architecture**: Implements a clear separation between data models, view templates, and controller logic for gift processing
2. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with the server-side components through standardized API endpoints for CRUD operations on gift data
3. **Client-side Validation**: Performs comprehensive validation of gift data before submission to ensure data integrity
4. **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a consistent interface that works across desktop and mobile devices
5. **State Management**: Maintains gift processing state across multiple form steps and batch operations

## Overview
The architecture follows a component-based approach with reusable UI elements for gift entry forms, batch management interfaces, and reporting tools. The module integrates with the core Petra authentication and permission systems to enforce appropriate access controls. Data synchronization with the server is handled through asynchronous requests, with appropriate error handling and user feedback mechanisms. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through consistent patterns and comprehensive documentation of the gift processing business logic.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/src/forms/Finance/Gift/GiftEntry

This module provides a modern web-based interface for handling gift entry, bank imports, and recurring gift management within the broader non-profit administration platform.

The sub-project is structured around three primary functional areas:

- **Gift Batch Management**: Handles creation, editing, and posting of gift batches with associated transactions
- **Recurring Gift Processing**: Manages SEPA direct debit and recurring donation workflows
- **Bank Statement Import**: Provides functionality to import and transform bank transactions from various formats (CSV, CAMT, MT940)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Modular Template Architecture**: Each functional area has dedicated HTML templates and JavaScript controllers that follow consistent patterns
2. **Client-Server Communication**: JavaScript controllers manage API interactions with the server for data retrieval and persistence
3. **Rich UI Components**: Implements autocomplete for donors, motivation codes, accounts, and cost centers
4. **Transaction Transformation**: Logic for converting bank imports to gifts or general ledger entries
5. **Export Capabilities**: Supports exporting financial data in various formats including Excel and SEPA

#### Technical Architecture

The architecture follows a template-controller pattern where HTML files define the UI structure while JavaScript files implement the business logic and server interactions. The code leverages Bootstrap for styling and includes specialized components for financial data handling. The module integrates with OpenPetra's broader authentication and data management systems while maintaining a focused responsibility on gift entry workflows.

### js-client/src/forms/Finance/Gift/GiftReceipting

The program handles financial transactions and donor relationship management. This sub-project implements the client-side functionality for generating and distributing annual gift receipts along with template management capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic generation of annual gift receipts in PDF format
- Customizable receipt templates with logo and signature support
- Multiple distribution methods (download, print, email)
- Template persistence and default management
- Donor selection with autocomplete functionality

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Template Management System: Handles loading, storing, and managing HTML templates, logos, and signatures for consistent receipt generation
2. Multi-format Output Support: Provides options to generate receipts as downloadable PDFs, printable documents, or email attachments
3. Server-Client Communication: Implements API calls to the backend for receipt generation and donor data retrieval
4. Default Configuration Persistence: Allows saving and retrieving default templates and settings for streamlined workflow
5. Interactive User Interface: Offers date range selection, donor filtering, and real-time feedback during processing operations

#### Overview
The architecture follows a client-side JavaScript approach that interfaces with OpenPetra's backend services. The presentation layer consists of HTML templates and JavaScript controllers that handle user interactions and API communications. The design emphasizes flexibility in receipt customization while maintaining a consistent user experience. The system supports both batch processing for multiple donors and targeted receipt generation for specific donors, with comprehensive error handling and processing feedback through modal dialogs.
