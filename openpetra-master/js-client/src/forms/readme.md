# JavaScript Client Forms Subproject Of Petra

The Petra is a web application that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks through an integrated platform. The program handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while providing a user-friendly interface for data management. This sub-project implements the client-side form handling and UI components along with internationalization support for the web interface. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic version information display
- Localized content rendering
- Responsive UI components using jQuery and Bootstrap
- Asynchronous data loading with Axios

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Separation of HTML Templates and JavaScript Logic**: Clear separation between presentation templates (.html) and functional logic (.js) for maintainability
2. **Internationalization Support**: Integration with i18next for translation and localization of content
3. **Asynchronous API Communication**: Uses Axios and jQuery AJAX to fetch data from server endpoints
4. **Content Placeholder System**: Templates use {placeholder} syntax for dynamic content injection
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Implements fallback mechanisms for content loading (e.g., language fallback)

## Overview
The JavaScript Client Forms architecture follows a modular approach with distinct UI components that handle specific functional areas like application information (About) and version updates (ReleaseNotes). The code demonstrates a clean separation between presentation and logic layers, with HTML templates defining structure and JavaScript files implementing dynamic behaviors. The system uses modern web technologies for asynchronous communication with server endpoints and supports internationalization through a robust localization framework. The design prioritizes user experience while maintaining a maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/src/forms/Settings

This sub-project implements user preference management and localization features along with secure credential handling. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- User interface for language selection and switching
- Secure password management and validation

## Business Functions

### About and Information
- `About.js` : A simple JavaScript module that displays the OpenPetra version number in the About page.
- `About.html` : About page template for OpenPetra displaying application information, support details, and version number.
- `ReleaseNotes.js` : Loads and displays release notes in the user's language or falls back to English.
- `ReleaseNotes.html` : Empty HTML container for displaying release notes in the OpenPetra web client.

## Files
### About.html

This HTML template defines the About page for OpenPetra. It displays information about the application including a description, target audience, manual text, support information, and subscription details. The template uses placeholders like {caption}, {description}, and {login.support_text} that will be populated with actual content when rendered. A footer section displays the current version of the application with a span element that will contain the version number.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses container layout with Bootstrap grid system for responsive design
- `Line 16`: Footer contains a version span that likely gets populated dynamically by JavaScript
### About.js

This JavaScript file implements functionality for the About page in OpenPetra's web client. It uses jQuery to execute code when the document is ready, making an API call to the serverSessionManager.asmx/GetVersion endpoint to retrieve the application version. Upon receiving the version data, it updates all HTML elements with the 'version' class to display the current OpenPetra version number. The file is minimal but provides essential version information display functionality for the About page.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 26`: Uses jQuery's document.ready pattern to ensure DOM is fully loaded before executing code
- `Line 28`: Makes an asynchronous API call using the api.post method with Promise handling
### ReleaseNotes.html

This file contains a minimal HTML structure with a single empty div element with the ID 'contentReleaseNotes'. This div serves as a container where release notes content will be dynamically loaded and displayed in the OpenPetra web client interface. The file itself contains no actual release notes content or JavaScript functionality.
### ReleaseNotes.js

This file implements functionality to load and display OpenPetra release notes. When the document is ready, it creates an Axios instance to fetch release notes from the server. It first attempts to load the notes in the user's current language using i18next for translation. If that fails, it falls back to loading the English version. The loaded HTML content is then inserted into the #contentReleaseNotes element on the page.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 27`: Uses document ready function to ensure DOM is loaded before executing code
- `Line 31`: Adds timestamp parameter to prevent caching of release notes
- `Line 33`: Creates dedicated Axios instance with baseURL for release notes requests
- `Line 38`: Uses i18next for internationalization of the release notes URL path
