# JavaScript Client Partner Types

The JavaScript Client Partner Types is a frontend component of OpenPetra that implements the user interface for managing partner type definitions within the system. This subproject provides a complete interface for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting partner types through a browser-based interface. The implementation follows a template-based architecture with clear separation between HTML structure and JavaScript functionality.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- CRUD operations for partner type management
- Structured display of partner types in a formatted list view
- Modal-based editing interface for modifying partner type properties
- Client-side validation and state management
- RESTful API communication with the backend server

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based UI Architecture**: Uses phantom HTML elements as templates that are cloned and populated dynamically
2. **State Management**: Maintains application state in JavaScript variables like `last_requested_data` to preserve context between operations
3. **Modal Dialog Pattern**: Implements create/edit operations through modal dialogs rather than page transitions
4. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with the server through standardized API calls for data operations
5. **Responsive Design**: Leverages Bootstrap components for a consistent and responsive user interface

## Overview
The architecture follows modern web application patterns with clear separation between structure (HTML) and behavior (JavaScript). The MaintainTypes.js file handles all dynamic functionality including data loading, user interactions, and server communication, while MaintainTypes.html provides the template structure. This design promotes maintainability by isolating UI components and facilitates future enhancements to the partner type management functionality.

## Business Functions

### Partner Type Management
- `MaintainTypes.js` : Frontend component for managing partner types in OpenPetra, handling display, creation, editing and deletion operations.
- `MaintainTypes.html` : HTML template for partner type maintenance interface with modals for viewing, editing, and creating partner types.

## Files
### MaintainTypes.html

This HTML template implements a user interface for maintaining partner types in OpenPetra. It provides a list view of partner types with buttons to view details and edit entries. The file contains template structures for displaying type information, editing existing types, and creating new ones through modal dialogs. Key functionality includes viewing type details in collapsible sections, editing type properties (category, code, description, validity), and adding new types. The template uses phantom storage for HTML templates and includes buttons for common operations like save, delete, and close.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses phantom hidden div as template storage for dynamic content generation
- `Line 83`: Modal dialog with 'modal-wide' class for editing partner types
- `Line 116`: Similar modal structure for creating new entries with slightly different initial state
- `Line 201`: References external JavaScript libraries for utilities, templates and modal handling
### MaintainTypes.js

MaintainTypes.js implements the frontend functionality for managing partner types in OpenPetra. It provides a user interface to view, create, edit, and delete partner types. The file loads partner type data from the server, displays it in a formatted list, and handles user interactions through modal dialogs. Key functions include display_list() for loading and showing partner types, open_edit() and open_new() for displaying edit/create modals, and save_entry(), save_new(), and delete_entry() for persisting changes to the server via API calls. The code uses templates defined in phantom elements and maintains state in the last_requested_data variable.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Uses API calls to load partner types from the server and parse JSON response
- `Line 43`: Sanitizes type codes by removing special characters for DOM ID usage
- `Line 87`: Implements a translation function to convert UI data to server-compatible format
