# JavaScript Client Partner Setup Of Petra

The Petra is a web-based application that provides comprehensive administration tools for non-profit organizations. The program manages contact information, accounting, and sponsorship while providing a user-friendly interface for data management. This sub-project implements the JavaScript client-side functionality for Partner Setup management, focusing on consent management components for GDPR compliance and partner communication preferences.  This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Consent channel management (communication methods)
- Consent purpose management (reasons for communication)
- CRUD operations for consent-related data
- Modal-based user interfaces for efficient data management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based UI Architecture**: Separates HTML templates from JavaScript functionality, allowing for clean separation of concerns between presentation and logic
2. **API Integration**: Communicates with server-side components through the TPartnerSetupWebConnector for data operations
3. **Consistent UI Patterns**: Implements standardized patterns for browsing, viewing, editing, and creating records across different entity types
4. **Internationalization Support**: Includes support for translating UI elements to support global deployment

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach with separate files for HTML templates and JavaScript functionality. The HTML templates define the structure and appearance using Bootstrap for styling, while the JavaScript files handle data retrieval, manipulation, and user interactions. The code is organized around specific entity types (consent channels and purposes) with consistent patterns for CRUD operations. This design promotes maintainability and extensibility while providing a consistent user experience across the partner management components.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Setup/Types

This subproject provides a complete interface for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting partner types through a browser-based interface. The implementation follows a template-based architecture with clear separation between HTML structure and JavaScript functionality.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- CRUD operations for partner type management
- Structured display of partner types in a formatted list view
- Modal-based editing interface for modifying partner type properties
- Client-side validation and state management
- RESTful API communication with the backend server

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based UI Architecture**: Uses phantom HTML elements as templates that are cloned and populated dynamically
2. **State Management**: Maintains application state in JavaScript variables like `last_requested_data` to preserve context between operations
3. **Modal Dialog Pattern**: Implements create/edit operations through modal dialogs rather than page transitions
4. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with the server through standardized API calls for data operations
5. **Responsive Design**: Leverages Bootstrap components for a consistent and responsive user interface

#### Overview
The architecture follows modern web application patterns with clear separation between structure (HTML) and behavior (JavaScript). The MaintainTypes.js file handles all dynamic functionality including data loading, user interactions, and server communication, while MaintainTypes.html provides the template structure. This design promotes maintainability by isolating UI components and facilitates future enhancements to the partner type management functionality.

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Setup/Subscription

The program handles contact management and accounting operations while supporting international currency transactions. This sub-project implements the client-side publication management functionality along with the associated user interface templates. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Publication record management through a responsive web interface
- JSON-based API communication with the server backend
- Template-driven UI components for consistent user experience
- Modal dialog interfaces for creating and editing publication data

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation logic in JavaScript and server-side data operations through API calls
2. **Template-Based UI**: Uses HTML templates stored in phantom storage for rendering different views of publication data
3. **Modal Dialog Pattern**: Implements create/edit operations through modal overlays rather than page transitions
4. **Collapsible Detail Views**: Employs expandable sections to show detailed publication information without cluttering the main list view

#### Overview
The architecture follows a modern web application pattern with JavaScript handling client-side interactions and HTML templates defining the UI structure. The MaintainPublications.js file contains the core functionality for CRUD operations on publication records, making appropriate API calls to the server and updating the UI accordingly. The companion HTML file provides the templates needed for rendering lists, detail views, and edit forms. The design emphasizes usability through collapsible sections and modal dialogs, while maintaining a clean separation between presentation and business logic.

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Setup/Memberships

The JavaScript Client Partner Memberships subproject implements the frontend functionality for managing membership types within the Partner module. This component provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete CRUD operations for membership records
- Structured UI presentation through templated components
- Client-side data validation and formatting
- Modal-based editing workflow for membership management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between HTML templates (view) and JavaScript controllers (controller) with data models defined through API interactions
2. **Template-Based Rendering**: Uses phantom storage templates for consistent UI components that can be dynamically populated
3. **Modal Dialog Workflow**: Implements a user-friendly approach to data editing through modal dialogs rather than page transitions
4. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with server endpoints (serverMPartner.asmx) for data persistence operations

#### Overview
The architecture follows a component-based design with clear separation between presentation and business logic. The MaintainMemberships.js controller handles all user interactions and API calls, while the corresponding HTML template defines the UI structure. The system supports comprehensive membership management including properties like codes, descriptions, frequencies (Annual/Quarterly/Monthly), fees, and service hours. The design emphasizes reusability through templating, maintains consistent styling, and provides a clean workflow for administrators managing organization membership types.
