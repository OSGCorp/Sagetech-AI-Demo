# JavaScript Client Partner Memberships

The Petra application is a JavaScript-based system that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The JavaScript Client Partner Memberships subproject implements the frontend functionality for managing membership types within the Partner module. This component provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Complete CRUD operations for membership records
- Structured UI presentation through templated components
- Client-side data validation and formatting
- Modal-based editing workflow for membership management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between HTML templates (view) and JavaScript controllers (controller) with data models defined through API interactions
2. **Template-Based Rendering**: Uses phantom storage templates for consistent UI components that can be dynamically populated
3. **Modal Dialog Workflow**: Implements a user-friendly approach to data editing through modal dialogs rather than page transitions
4. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with server endpoints (serverMPartner.asmx) for data persistence operations

## Overview
The architecture follows a component-based design with clear separation between presentation and business logic. The MaintainMemberships.js controller handles all user interactions and API calls, while the corresponding HTML template defines the UI structure. The system supports comprehensive membership management including properties like codes, descriptions, frequencies (Annual/Quarterly/Monthly), fees, and service hours. The design emphasizes reusability through templating, maintains consistent styling, and provides a clean workflow for administrators managing organization membership types.

## Business Functions

### Membership Management
- `MaintainMemberships.js` : Manages membership types in OpenPetra, handling display, creation, editing, and deletion of membership records.
- `MaintainMemberships.html` : HTML template for managing membership types in the Partner Setup module of OpenPetra.

## Files
### MaintainMemberships.html

This HTML template provides the user interface for managing membership types in OpenPetra's Partner Setup module. It defines three main components: a list view showing existing memberships, a modal dialog for editing membership details, and another modal for creating new memberships. Each membership has properties including code, description, frequency (Annual/Quarterly/Monthly), fee, and service hours. The template includes buttons for creating, editing, and deleting memberships, with appropriate form fields for data entry. The file uses phantom storage for templates and references external JavaScript libraries for utilities, templating, and modal functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses phantom storage pattern to define reusable HTML templates that are hidden from view until needed
- `Line 4`: Template system with {val_*} placeholders for dynamic content insertion
- `Line 15`: Collapsible row design pattern for showing/hiding detailed membership information
- `Line 218`: References external JavaScript libraries for utilities, templating, and modal functionality
### MaintainMemberships.js

MaintainMemberships.js implements functionality for managing membership types in the OpenPetra partner module. It handles loading, displaying, creating, editing, and deleting membership records through API calls to serverMPartner.asmx. The file provides functions for displaying membership lists, formatting individual items, opening detail views, editing existing memberships, creating new ones, and performing CRUD operations. Key functions include display_list(), format_item(), open_detail(), open_edit(), open_new(), save_new(), save_entry(), and delete_entry(). The code uses templates for rendering UI components and maintains state in the last_requested_data variable.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Uses API post calls to load membership data from the server and dynamically builds the UI
- `Line 42`: Creates clean IDs by removing special characters from membership codes for DOM manipulation
- `Line 61`: Implements collapsible UI pattern for showing/hiding membership details
- `Line 94`: Handles empty numeric fields by converting them to zero before sending to server
