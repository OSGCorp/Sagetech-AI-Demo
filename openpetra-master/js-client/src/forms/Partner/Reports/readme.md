# JavaScript Client Partner Reports

The JavaScript Client Partner Reports is a frontend module within the OpenPetra application that provides dynamic reporting capabilities for partner-related data. This client-side implementation leverages modern JavaScript frameworks to deliver interactive reporting interfaces that communicate with OpenPetra's backend services.

The module implements a component-based architecture that separates concerns between data retrieval, report generation, and UI presentation. Reports are dynamically generated based on user-selected parameters, with results rendered in various formats including tabular data, charts, and exportable documents.

## Key Technical Features

- Asynchronous API integration for fetching partner data without page reloads
- Parameterized report generation with dynamic filtering capabilities
- Client-side data transformation and aggregation to minimize server load
- Exportable report formats (PDF, CSV, Excel) generated in the browser
- Responsive design for reports that adapt to different screen sizes
- Interactive data visualization components for key metrics

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between data models, view templates, and controller logic
2. **Component Reusability**: Common reporting widgets that can be composed into different report types
3. **State Management**: Client-side caching of report parameters and results to improve performance
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Report components communicate through a publish-subscribe pattern
5. **Internationalization Support**: Report labels and formatting adapt to user language preferences

The architecture prioritizes performance through client-side processing where appropriate, while maintaining security by enforcing proper data access controls. Engineers working on this module should understand both the JavaScript frontend patterns and the underlying data structures of the partner management system.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Reports/PartnerReports

The program provides contact management and reporting capabilities while maintaining a clean separation between client and server components. This sub-project implements client-side report templates and associated JavaScript functionality for partner-related reports, along with configuration files that connect the front-end interfaces to server-side processing logic. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic report generation with customizable filters
- Multiple export formats (HTML, Excel, PDF)
- Consent-based filtering for privacy compliance
- Partner categorization by various attributes (city, subscription, special type)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: JSON configuration files connect HTML templates with server-side processing classes
2. **Modular Report Components**: Each report consists of HTML template, JavaScript controller, and JSON configuration
3. **Dynamic Form Generation**: JavaScript controllers dynamically populate form elements based on server data
4. **Standardized Report Processing**: Common patterns for parameter collection and report submission
5. **Consent Management Integration**: Built-in support for filtering based on communication consent preferences

#### Overview
The architecture follows a consistent pattern where JSON configuration files define the relationship between client templates and server processing classes. HTML templates provide the user interface structure, while JavaScript controllers handle dynamic content loading, form validation, and report generation requests. The design emphasizes reusability through common utility functions and standardized approaches to report parameter collection. Reports cover various partner categorizations including special types, city, subscription status, and annual reporting requirements.
