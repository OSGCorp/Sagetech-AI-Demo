# JavaScript Client Partners Of Petra

JavaScript Client Partners is a frontend module that provides user interfaces for managing partner data within the OpenPetra system. The module implements responsive web interfaces for creating, editing, and importing partner records including individuals, families, and organizations. This subproject serves as the primary user-facing component for partner management, handling both data presentation and user interactions through modern JavaScript and HTML templates.

The JavaScript Client Partners module provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Comprehensive partner data management (creation, editing, deletion)
- Multi-format data import (CSV, ODS, XLSX)
- Contact information management with GDPR consent tracking
- Partner relationship management (families, organizations)
- Financial data integration (bank accounts, contributions)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Bootstrap-Based Responsive UI**: Templates utilize Bootstrap for consistent styling and responsive design across different screen sizes
2. **Modal Dialog System**: Implements modal dialogs for focused data entry and confirmation actions
3. **Tabbed Interface Architecture**: Complex partner data is organized into logical sections through a tabbed interface
4. **API Integration**: Client-side JavaScript communicates with server endpoints for data operations
5. **File Processing Capabilities**: Handles multiple file formats for importing partner data with appropriate validation

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation (HTML templates) and behavior (JavaScript), with comprehensive partner management capabilities. The module handles both simple and complex partner data operations while maintaining compliance with data protection regulations through consent tracking features. The design emphasizes user experience with responsive interfaces, clear data organization, and appropriate feedback during operations.

## Files
### ImportPartners.html

This HTML template provides a user interface for importing partner data into OpenPetra from different file formats. It includes file upload inputs for CSV, ODS, and XLSX files, with corresponding buttons to trigger file selection dialogs. The page features a simple layout with a header, help button linking to documentation, import buttons for different file types, and a button to delete all contacts. A modal dialog is included to display a 'Please Wait' message during processing operations. The template uses Bootstrap for styling and includes Font Awesome icons.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-3`: Hidden file input elements with specific file type restrictions that trigger different upload handler functions based on file format.
- `Line 15-23`: Button click handlers that programmatically trigger file input dialogs, providing a better user experience than raw file inputs.
- `Line 32-44`: Modal implementation for displaying wait status during potentially long-running import operations.
### ImportPartners.js

This file implements functionality for importing partner data into OpenPetra from various file formats. It provides three main functions for uploading partner data: UploadUserCSV for CSV files, UploadUserODS for ODS files, and UploadUserXLSX for XLSX files. Each function reads the selected file, sends its content to the server via API calls, and displays success or error messages. Additionally, it implements DeleteAllContacts to remove all partner records after confirmation. The file also includes helper functions showPleaseWait and hidePleaseWait to manage loading indicators during API operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Checks browser compatibility for File APIs before proceeding with file operations
- `Line 42`: Uses FileReader API to asynchronously read CSV file contents before sending to server
- `Line 147`: Implements confirmation dialog before allowing deletion of all partner records
