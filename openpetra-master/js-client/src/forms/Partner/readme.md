# JavaScript Client Partner of Petra

The JavaScript Client Partner is a front-end component of OpenPetra that provides a modern web interface for interacting with the OpenPetra server. This subproject implements the client-side rendering and interaction logic along with server communication protocols. It provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic HTML interface generation based on server-side data models
- Client-side form validation and data processing
- Asynchronous communication with the OpenPetra server API
- Responsive UI components using Bootstrap framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Architecture**: Implements a client-side Model-View-Controller pattern that mirrors the server-side structure for consistency and maintainability
2. **Template-Based Rendering**: Uses HTML templates with JavaScript-based data binding for efficient UI updates
3. **RESTful API Integration**: Communicates with server endpoints using standardized REST patterns for data retrieval and submission
4. **Component-Based Structure**: Organizes functionality into reusable components for screens like partner management, finance, and reporting
5. **Event-Driven Interaction**: Implements event listeners and handlers to manage user interactions and UI state changes

## Overview

The JavaScript Client Partner architecture emphasizes separation of concerns through its component structure, with distinct modules handling data access, UI rendering, and business logic. The client communicates with the server via JSON-based API calls, handling both data retrieval and submission. Form components automatically validate input against server-defined data models before submission. The UI is built on Bootstrap for responsive design and consistent styling across the application. Error handling includes both client-side validation and graceful handling of server-side errors with appropriate user feedback.

## Sub-Projects

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Setup

The program manages contact information, accounting, and sponsorship while providing a user-friendly interface for data management. This sub-project implements the JavaScript client-side functionality for Partner Setup management, focusing on consent management components for GDPR compliance and partner communication preferences.  This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Consent channel management (communication methods)
- Consent purpose management (reasons for communication)
- CRUD operations for consent-related data
- Modal-based user interfaces for efficient data management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based UI Architecture**: Separates HTML templates from JavaScript functionality, allowing for clean separation of concerns between presentation and logic
2. **API Integration**: Communicates with server-side components through the TPartnerSetupWebConnector for data operations
3. **Consistent UI Patterns**: Implements standardized patterns for browsing, viewing, editing, and creating records across different entity types
4. **Internationalization Support**: Includes support for translating UI elements to support global deployment

#### Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach with separate files for HTML templates and JavaScript functionality. The HTML templates define the structure and appearance using Bootstrap for styling, while the JavaScript files handle data retrieval, manipulation, and user interactions. The code is organized around specific entity types (consent channels and purposes) with consistent patterns for CRUD operations. This design promotes maintainability and extensibility while providing a consistent user experience across the partner management components.

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Partners

The module implements responsive web interfaces for creating, editing, and importing partner records including individuals, families, and organizations. This subproject serves as the primary user-facing component for partner management, handling both data presentation and user interactions through modern JavaScript and HTML templates.

The JavaScript Client Partners module provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Comprehensive partner data management (creation, editing, deletion)
- Multi-format data import (CSV, ODS, XLSX)
- Contact information management with GDPR consent tracking
- Partner relationship management (families, organizations)
- Financial data integration (bank accounts, contributions)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Bootstrap-Based Responsive UI**: Templates utilize Bootstrap for consistent styling and responsive design across different screen sizes
2. **Modal Dialog System**: Implements modal dialogs for focused data entry and confirmation actions
3. **Tabbed Interface Architecture**: Complex partner data is organized into logical sections through a tabbed interface
4. **API Integration**: Client-side JavaScript communicates with server endpoints for data operations
5. **File Processing Capabilities**: Handles multiple file formats for importing partner data with appropriate validation

#### Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation (HTML templates) and behavior (JavaScript), with comprehensive partner management capabilities. The module handles both simple and complex partner data operations while maintaining compliance with data protection regulations through consent tracking features. The design emphasizes user experience with responsive interfaces, clear data organization, and appropriate feedback during operations.

### js-client/src/forms/Partner/Reports

This client-side implementation leverages modern JavaScript frameworks to deliver interactive reporting interfaces that communicate with OpenPetra's backend services.

The module implements a component-based architecture that separates concerns between data retrieval, report generation, and UI presentation. Reports are dynamically generated based on user-selected parameters, with results rendered in various formats including tabular data, charts, and exportable documents.

#### Key Technical Features

- Asynchronous API integration for fetching partner data without page reloads
- Parameterized report generation with dynamic filtering capabilities
- Client-side data transformation and aggregation to minimize server load
- Exportable report formats (PDF, CSV, Excel) generated in the browser
- Responsive design for reports that adapt to different screen sizes
- Interactive data visualization components for key metrics

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between data models, view templates, and controller logic
2. **Component Reusability**: Common reporting widgets that can be composed into different report types
3. **State Management**: Client-side caching of report parameters and results to improve performance
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Report components communicate through a publish-subscribe pattern
5. **Internationalization Support**: Report labels and formatting adapt to user language preferences

The architecture prioritizes performance through client-side processing where appropriate, while maintaining security by enforcing proper data access controls. Engineers working on this module should understand both the JavaScript frontend patterns and the underlying data structures of the partner management system.
