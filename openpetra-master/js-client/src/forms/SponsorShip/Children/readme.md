# JavaScript Client Sponsorship Children Of Petra

The Petra is a web application that helps non-profit organizations manage sponsorship programs and administrative tasks. The program handles contact management and sponsorship tracking while providing both user interface and data management capabilities. This sub-project implements the client-side sponsorship children management interface along with the necessary JavaScript functionality to interact with the backend services. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Comprehensive child record management with filtering and search capabilities
- Multi-tabbed interface for organizing child information (details, sponsorship, reminders, family/school)
- Modal-based editing of child records, comments, and sponsorship details
- Photo upload and management for child profiles
- PDF report generation for sponsored children

## Identified Design Elements

1. HTML/JavaScript Separation: Clear division between template structure (MaintainChildren.html) and behavioral logic (MaintainChildren.js)
2. Object-Oriented Architecture: Organized into specialized classes (MaintainChildren, MaintainChildComments, MaintainChildSponsorship, MaintainChildReminders)
3. Modal Dialog Pattern: Uses modal overlays for editing different aspects of child records without page navigation
4. Tab-Based Information Organization: Segments child information into logical categories for improved usability
5. Filter-Based Data Retrieval: Implements comprehensive filtering to efficiently locate specific child records

## Overview
The architecture follows a component-based approach with clear separation between presentation templates and JavaScript functionality. The interface is designed for efficient management of child sponsorship data, with specialized components handling different aspects of the sponsorship process. The system supports both viewing summary information in list format and detailed record management through expandable sections and modal dialogs, providing a comprehensive yet user-friendly interface for sponsorship administrators.

## Business Functions

### Sponsorship Management
- `MaintainChildren.html` : HTML template for managing sponsored children, including filtering, viewing, and editing child records with sponsorship details.
- `MaintainChildren.js` : JavaScript component for managing child sponsorship records in OpenPetra, including filtering, viewing, editing and creating child profiles.

## Files
### MaintainChildren.html

This HTML template implements the user interface for managing sponsored children in OpenPetra. It provides a filtering form to search for children by name, donor, sponsorship status, and other criteria. The main functionality includes displaying child records in a list view, with detailed information accessible through expandable sections. The file defines multiple modal dialogs for editing child details, comments, reminders, and sponsorship information. Key components include the main filter form, child listing template, detail view with tabs for different information categories (details, sponsorship, reminders, family and school situations), and modals for editing various aspects of child records.

### MaintainChildren.js

MaintainChildren.js implements the user interface for managing children in a sponsorship program. It provides functionality to filter, view, edit, and create child records with their associated data. The file defines four main classes: MaintainChildren for general child management, MaintainChildComments for handling family and school situation comments, MaintainChildSponsorship for managing recurring gift sponsorships, and MaintainChildReminders for date reminders. Key functions include filtering and displaying children records, uploading photos, maintaining sponsorship details, and generating PDF reports. The interface allows users to view comprehensive child information across multiple tabs including personal details, family situations, school situations, sponsorship information, and reminders.
