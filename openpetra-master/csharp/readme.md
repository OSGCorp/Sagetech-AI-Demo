# C# Code Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra C# codebase forms the core implementation of this open-source administration system for non-profit organizations. The application is built using a multi-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers. This subproject implements the server-side processing components and client-facing interfaces that power OpenPetra's comprehensive administrative capabilities.

## Key Technical Features

- **Multi-tier Architecture**: Separation of concerns across presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- **Module-based Organization**: Functionality divided into discrete modules (Finance, Personnel, Partner, etc.)
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on both Windows and Linux environments
- **RESTful API**: Provides programmatic access to all system functions
- **Data Validation Framework**: Ensures data integrity across all modules
- **Internationalization Support**: Enables localization for global deployment

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Business logic exposed through well-defined service interfaces that abstract underlying implementation details
2. **ORM Integration**: Uses NHibernate for database abstraction, allowing database independence
3. **Dependency Injection**: Employs IoC principles for better testability and component decoupling
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implements intelligent caching to optimize performance for frequently accessed data
5. **Security Framework**: Comprehensive authentication and authorization system with role-based access control
6. **Reporting Engine**: Flexible reporting infrastructure supporting various output formats

## Overview
The C# codebase follows SOLID principles and emphasizes maintainability and extensibility. The modular design allows for targeted enhancements without affecting the entire system. Database interactions are abstracted through repositories, business rules are encapsulated in service classes, and the presentation layer leverages modern web technologies for responsive user interfaces.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT

The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the International Clearing House (ICT) functionality along with the supporting data structures and processing logic. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Cross-currency transaction management
- International payment clearing and reconciliation
- Multi-organization financial data exchange
- Automated currency conversion and fee calculation
  - Exchange rate application
  - Transaction fee management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Transaction Processing Pipeline: A structured workflow for handling international transactions from initiation through clearing and settlement
2. Currency Management System: Handles exchange rates, conversion calculations, and fee structures across multiple currencies
3. Organization Interface Layer: Provides standardized communication protocols between participating organizations
4. Audit and Compliance Framework: Ensures all transactions are properly tracked, documented and compliant with international regulations

#### Overview
The ICT architecture follows a modular design that separates transaction processing, currency management, and organizational interfaces. It implements robust validation at each processing stage to ensure data integrity across international boundaries. The system minimizes currency exchange costs through intelligent routing and batching of transactions. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through clear separation of concerns between financial logic, data persistence, and the API layer that serves both internal OpenPetra components and external organizational systems.

### csharp/ThirdParty

This subproject doesn't contain application code itself, but rather organizes and maintains the collection of third-party components that provide essential functionality to the OpenPetra ecosystem.

The subproject serves as a dependency management layer that:

- Centralizes external library references for consistent versioning across the application
- Provides namespace mapping to corresponding DLL paths for build system resolution
- Includes critical libraries for:
  - PDF generation and manipulation (PDFsharp)
  - Internationalization support (GNU.Gettext)
  - Data compression and archiving (SharpZipLib)
  - Database connectivity (Npgsql, MySqlConnector)
  - JSON serialization/deserialization (Newtonsoft.Json)
  - Testing infrastructure (NUnit)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Dependency Isolation**: Third-party code is clearly separated from OpenPetra's own codebase, with distinct licensing documentation
2. **Namespace Resolution**: The namespace.map file provides a centralized configuration for resolving assembly references
3. **Multi-Database Support**: Includes connectors for different database systems, enabling deployment flexibility
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Libraries selected support OpenPetra's cross-platform requirements

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean dependency management, proper attribution of third-party code, and flexible deployment options. By centralizing these dependencies, the project maintains consistency across builds and simplifies the process of updating external libraries when needed.
