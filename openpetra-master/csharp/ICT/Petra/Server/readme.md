# C# Petra Server Of Petra

The Petra is a comprehensive open-source administration system designed for non-profit organizations. The C# Petra Server subproject implements the server-side components of the OpenPetra platform, providing a robust backend infrastructure that supports the application's core functionality. This server implementation handles data processing, business logic, and client-server communication through a service-oriented architecture.

## Key Technical Capabilities

- Multi-tier architecture separating presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- RESTful API endpoints for client communication with support for both JSON and XML formats
- Comprehensive data model supporting non-profit administration workflows including:
  - Contact management and relationship tracking
  - Financial accounting and reporting
  - Sponsorship program administration
  - Publication management and distribution

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Modular services handle specific functional domains with well-defined interfaces
2. **Data Persistence Layer**: Abstraction over database operations with support for multiple database backends
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Role-based access control system to manage user permissions
4. **Internationalization Support**: Built-in localization capabilities for multilingual deployment
5. **Clearing House Functionality**: Specialized components for international financial transaction processing

## Technical Implementation

The server is built on the .NET platform, leveraging C# language features for type safety and maintainability. It implements a stateless design to support scalability and follows RESTful principles for API design. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, allowing for independent development and testing of different functional modules.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/app

The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the server-side application logic and API endpoints along with the core business logic processing capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- RESTful API services for client applications
- Business logic implementation for financial and administrative operations
- Data persistence and retrieval operations
- Multi-tenant architecture support for organization separation
- Security and authentication services

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: The server applications are structured around discrete services that handle specific business domains like accounting, personnel, and donor management
2. **Multi-Layered Design**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
3. **Internationalization Support**: Built-in capabilities for handling multiple languages, currencies, and regional formats
4. **Modular Plugin System**: Core functionality can be extended through plugins for specialized organizational needs
5. **Distributed Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity across complex financial operations spanning multiple systems

#### Overview
The architecture follows enterprise application patterns with dependency injection for testability and maintainability. The server applications handle both synchronous and asynchronous processing requirements, with particular attention to data integrity in financial operations. The codebase implements robust error handling and logging to support operational requirements in mission-critical environments. Security is implemented at multiple levels with role-based access control and data segregation for multi-tenant deployments.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/lib

The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the server-side business logic and data access components along with the API interfaces that connect to client applications. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Data persistence and retrieval through ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Business logic implementation for financial, contact, and sponsorship management
- Authentication and authorization services
- Multi-tenant architecture support for hosting multiple organizations
- Cross-platform server deployment capabilities

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Service-Oriented Architecture: Core functionality is organized into discrete services that can be accessed through standardized interfaces
2. Data Access Layer Abstraction: Database operations are abstracted through a provider model allowing support for multiple database backends
3. Modular Design: Functionality is separated into distinct modules (accounting, contact management, etc.) that can be maintained independently
4. Internationalization Support: Built-in support for multiple languages and regional formatting requirements
5. Scalable Processing: Batch processing capabilities for handling large data operations efficiently

#### Overview
The architecture follows a multi-tier design with clear separation between data access, business logic, and service interfaces. The codebase employs dependency injection patterns to maintain loose coupling between components. Security is implemented through a comprehensive permission system that controls access at both feature and data levels. The server components are designed to support both local deployment and cloud hosting scenarios, with configuration options to adapt to various operational environments.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/sql

The program handles financial transactions and maintains comprehensive partner records. This sub-project implements SQL database queries and reference data structures that power OpenPetra's data access layer. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Structured data retrieval through parameterized SQL queries
- Financial transaction management (gifts, donations, accounting)
- Partner relationship and contact management
- Reference data configuration through YAML templates
- International Clearing House (ICH) transaction support
- Conference and personnel management data access

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Modular Query Organization**: Queries are organized by functional domain (Finance, Partner, Gift, Personnel, Conference) for maintainability
2. **Parameterized Queries**: SQL uses placeholders (? or ##placeholder##) for dynamic parameter substitution
3. **Conditional Query Building**: Many queries contain preprocessor directives for conditional inclusion of SQL clauses
4. **Hierarchical Reference Data**: YAML configuration files define standard hierarchies for accounts, cost centers, and motivations
5. **Extract Pattern**: Common pattern of extracting partner information based on various criteria for reporting and processing

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes reusable SQL components that support OpenPetra's business logic. Queries are designed to handle complex relationships between partners, gifts, financial transactions, and organizational structures. The reference data files provide standardized templates for accounting structures and financial categorization. The SQL components support both operational queries and reporting functions, with special attention to international financial operations through the ICH subsystem.
