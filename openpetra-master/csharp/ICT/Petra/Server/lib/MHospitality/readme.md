# C# Hospitality Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and contact management across international boundaries. This sub-project implements the hospitality management functionality within the OpenPetra ecosystem, though it is currently in a preliminary implementation state with placeholder functionality.

The C# Hospitality Module is designed to provide these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Conference and event management functionality
- Participant registration and tracking
- Resource allocation for hospitality events
- Permission-controlled access through the CONFERENCE module security context

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Web Connector Architecture**: Follows OpenPetra's server-client communication pattern through dedicated WebConnector classes
2. **Security Integration**: Incorporates OpenPetra's permission-based security model with specific module-level permissions
3. **Modular Design**: Structured as a distinct module (MHospitality) within the larger application architecture
4. **Extensible Framework**: Currently implemented as a placeholder structure ready for feature expansion

## Overview
The architecture is designed to integrate with OpenPetra's existing systems while maintaining a clear separation of concerns. The module is positioned within the server-side components and exposes functionality through web connectors. While currently in skeletal form, the structure demonstrates adherence to OpenPetra's architectural patterns, preparing for future development of hospitality management features. The module's permission requirements suggest it will handle conference-related functionality, likely supporting non-profit organizations in managing events and participant logistics.

## Business Functions

### Web Connectivity
- `web/webconnector.cs` : Placeholder webconnector class for the hospitality module in OpenPetra's server-side implementation.

## Files
### web/webconnector.cs

THospitalityWebConnector implements a placeholder class for the hospitality module's web connectivity. Currently, it contains only a dummy function marked with the CONFERENCE module permission requirement. The file establishes the namespace Ict.Petra.Server.MHospitality.WebConnectors and imports security functionality from the core application. This appears to be a skeleton implementation awaiting actual hospitality module functionality to be developed.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 36`: The [RequireModulePermission] attribute indicates integration with OpenPetra's security framework for access control
