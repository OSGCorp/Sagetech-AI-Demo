# C# Financial Development Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and supports organizational operations across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the financial development functionality along with web-based access controls for donation management and fundraising activities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Donor relationship management interfaces
- Financial development tracking and reporting
- Web-based access to fundraising data
- Permission-controlled financial development operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Module-Based Permission System: The TFinDevWebConnector requires specific 'FINANCE-2' module permissions, ensuring proper access control to sensitive financial development data
2. Web Connector Architecture: Implements a connector pattern to bridge web interfaces with the core financial development functionality
3. Extensible Framework: Currently contains placeholder methods designed for future implementation of complete financial development features
4. Namespace Organization: Structured within the Ict.Petra.Server.MFinDev.WebConnectors namespace for clear separation of concerns

## Overview
The architecture follows OpenPetra's modular design principles, with the financial development module specifically focused on fundraising and donor management capabilities. The web connector provides a standardized interface for accessing these features through web-based clients. While currently in early development with placeholder functionality, the framework is designed to support comprehensive financial development operations including donor tracking, campaign management, and fundraising analytics. The module integrates with OpenPetra's broader financial management system while maintaining its own specialized domain logic.

## Business Functions

### Financial Development
- `web/webconnector.cs` : Defines a web connector class for the financial development module with security permissions.

## Files
### web/webconnector.cs

TFinDevWebConnector implements a web connector class for OpenPetra's financial development module. This file establishes the foundation for web-based interactions with the financial development functionality, requiring the 'FINANCE-2' module permission for access. Currently, the class contains only a dummy placeholder method that will be replaced with actual financial development functionality in future implementations. The class is part of the Ict.Petra.Server.MFinDev.WebConnectors namespace.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Uses RequireModulePermission attribute for security enforcement, requiring 'FINANCE-2' permission to access financial development functionality
