# C# Petra Delegates Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a C# application that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and contact management while reducing operational overhead. This sub-project implements cross-module communication infrastructure and state management between server-side DLLs, eliminating circular dependencies. The C# Petra Delegates provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Thread-safe delegate initialization for server components
- Cross-module validation mechanisms for partner and finance operations
- Cacheable data table connections across system modules
- Runtime binding of implementation methods to validation helpers

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Dependency Resolution**: The delegate system enables communication between server-side DLLs without creating circular dependencies
2. **Thread Isolation**: Uses ThreadStatic variables to maintain separate cache populators for each thread, ensuring request isolation
3. **Module Interconnection**: Establishes connections between Common, Conference, Finance, Partner, and Personnel modules
4. **Request Lifecycle Management**: Initializes delegates at the start of each web request via the Init() method

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes loose coupling through delegate-based communication, maintains thread safety for web request processing, and provides comprehensive validation mechanisms across system modules. The delegate system is designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation between modules and robust state management across the application.

## Business Functions

### System Configuration
- `SetupDelegates.cs` : Sets up delegates to enable cross-DLL method calls in OpenPetra server, avoiding circular dependencies between components.

## Files
### SetupDelegates.cs

TSetupDelegates implements a class that initializes delegates to enable communication between different server-side DLLs without creating circular dependencies. It sets up validation delegates for partner and finance operations, and establishes connections to various cacheable data tables across different modules (Common, Conference, Finance, Partner, Personnel, etc.). The Init() method configures these delegates at the start of each web request, connecting validation helpers with their implementation methods and setting up cache population mechanisms for different modules. The class uses ThreadStatic variables to maintain separate cache populators for each thread.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 95`: Uses ThreadStatic attribute to ensure each thread has its own instance of cache populators, preventing thread safety issues
- `Line 107`: Establishes validation delegates that allow cross-module function calls without creating circular dependencies
- `Line 116`: Sets up a delegate system for cacheable data tables that enables server-side data caching
- `Line 144`: Initializes a cache manager with client task delegation for efficient data access
