# C# Petra Server Applications Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# application that provides administrative management for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the server-side application logic and API endpoints along with the core business logic processing capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- RESTful API services for client applications
- Business logic implementation for financial and administrative operations
- Data persistence and retrieval operations
- Multi-tenant architecture support for organization separation
- Security and authentication services

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: The server applications are structured around discrete services that handle specific business domains like accounting, personnel, and donor management
2. **Multi-Layered Design**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
3. **Internationalization Support**: Built-in capabilities for handling multiple languages, currencies, and regional formats
4. **Modular Plugin System**: Core functionality can be extended through plugins for specialized organizational needs
5. **Distributed Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity across complex financial operations spanning multiple systems

## Overview
The architecture follows enterprise application patterns with dependency injection for testability and maintainability. The server applications handle both synchronous and asynchronous processing requirements, with particular attention to data integrity in financial operations. The codebase implements robust error handling and logging to support operational requirements in mission-critical environments. Security is implemented at multiple levels with role-based access control and data segregation for multi-tenant deployments.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/app/Core

The program handles data management operations and provides security controls for accessing sensitive information. This sub-project implements the core server functionality along with security and authorization mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Database access security and permission management
- Server administration and management interfaces
- Scheduled processing and background job execution
- Comprehensive logging for errors, logins, and user activities
- System configuration and defaults management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Layered Security Model**: Implements both table-level and module-level access controls to ensure proper authorization for all operations
2. **Centralized Error Handling**: Provides structured error logging with context information, timestamps, and user details
3. **Administrative Web Interface**: Exposes server management capabilities through a web connector for remote administration
4. **Progress Tracking System**: Implements session-based progress tracking for long-running operations
5. **Scheduled Job Processing**: Supports timed execution of maintenance tasks with manual override capabilities

#### Overview
The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation between infrastructure, security, and application layers. The security model implements defense-in-depth with both coarse-grained module permissions and fine-grained table access controls. System state management includes both configuration defaults and progress tracking for long-running operations. The logging subsystem provides comprehensive audit trails for security events, errors, and user activities. The server management functionality supports database operations, user management, and system monitoring through a secure web interface.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/app/WebService

The program handles financial transactions and contact management while reducing operational overhead. This sub-project implements the web service interface layer along with session management capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication
- User authentication and session management
- Self-service account functionality
- Server environment initialization for web requests
- Navigation menu retrieval for UI construction

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Session Management Architecture: Implements comprehensive user authentication with login/logout functionality, password management, and persistent session tracking
2. Self-Service Capabilities: Provides account creation, confirmation workflows, and password reset functionality without administrator intervention
3. Server Environment Initialization: Automatically prepares the server context for each incoming web request
4. Client Connection Management: Maintains active client connections and provides polling mechanisms for asynchronous task monitoring

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes security through robust authentication mechanisms, provides self-service capabilities to reduce administrative overhead, and maintains clean separation between client and server concerns. The session management system serves as a critical integration point between the client interface and the core business logic of OpenPetra. The web service layer is designed for reliability and scalability, with comprehensive error handling and efficient resource management to support non-profit organizations' administrative needs.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/app/Delegates

The program handles financial transactions and contact management while reducing operational overhead. This sub-project implements cross-module communication infrastructure and state management between server-side DLLs, eliminating circular dependencies. The C# Petra Delegates provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Thread-safe delegate initialization for server components
- Cross-module validation mechanisms for partner and finance operations
- Cacheable data table connections across system modules
- Runtime binding of implementation methods to validation helpers

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Dependency Resolution**: The delegate system enables communication between server-side DLLs without creating circular dependencies
2. **Thread Isolation**: Uses ThreadStatic variables to maintain separate cache populators for each thread, ensuring request isolation
3. **Module Interconnection**: Establishes connections between Common, Conference, Finance, Partner, and Personnel modules
4. **Request Lifecycle Management**: Initializes delegates at the start of each web request via the Init() method

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes loose coupling through delegate-based communication, maintains thread safety for web request processing, and provides comprehensive validation mechanisms across system modules. The delegate system is designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation between modules and robust state management across the application.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Server/app/JsClient

This sub-project implements the JavaScript client interface layer along with the server-side controllers that support this interface. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic navigation menu generation based on user permissions
- Client-server communication interface with support for both JSON and HTML responses
- UI component rendering and management
- User authentication and authorization integration

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Permission-Based Navigation System**: The navigation controller dynamically builds menus from YAML configuration files, filtering options based on user access rights
2. **Hierarchical Menu Structure**: Navigation items are organized in a folder-based hierarchy that can be transformed between YAML, XML, and JSON formats
3. **Client-Side Integration**: Server-generated navigation structures are delivered to the JavaScript client in a format ready for rendering
4. **Extensible Configuration**: The navigation system is designed to be easily extended through configuration files rather than code changes

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes security through permission-based access control, configurability through external YAML definitions, and maintainability through clear separation between navigation structure and rendering logic. The navigation component serves as a bridge between the server-side authorization system and the client-side UI, ensuring users only see and access features they're permitted to use. This design allows for easy extension of the navigation structure without requiring code changes, while maintaining consistent security controls.
