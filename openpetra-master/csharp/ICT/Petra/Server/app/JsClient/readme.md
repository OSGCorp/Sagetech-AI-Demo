# C# Petra JavaScript Client Subproject Of Petra

The Petra is a C# program that provides administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. This sub-project implements the JavaScript client interface layer along with the server-side controllers that support this interface. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Dynamic navigation menu generation based on user permissions
- Client-server communication interface with support for both JSON and HTML responses
- UI component rendering and management
- User authentication and authorization integration

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Permission-Based Navigation System**: The navigation controller dynamically builds menus from YAML configuration files, filtering options based on user access rights
2. **Hierarchical Menu Structure**: Navigation items are organized in a folder-based hierarchy that can be transformed between YAML, XML, and JSON formats
3. **Client-Side Integration**: Server-generated navigation structures are delivered to the JavaScript client in a format ready for rendering
4. **Extensible Configuration**: The navigation system is designed to be easily extended through configuration files rather than code changes

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes security through permission-based access control, configurability through external YAML definitions, and maintainability through clear separation between navigation structure and rendering logic. The navigation component serves as a bridge between the server-side authorization system and the client-side UI, ensuring users only see and access features they're permitted to use. This design allows for easy extension of the navigation structure without requiring code changes, while maintaining consistent security controls.

## Business Functions

### Navigation Management
- `Navigation.cs` : Server-side component that generates navigation UI for OpenPetra's JavaScript client based on user permissions.

## Files
### Navigation.cs

TUINavigation implements functionality to generate navigation menus for the OpenPetra JavaScript client. It loads navigation structure from a YAML configuration file, converts it to XML, and then transforms it into a JSON-compatible dictionary structure that can be sent to the client. The class filters navigation items based on user permissions, ensuring users only see menu options they're authorized to access. Key methods include HasAccessPermission to check user access rights, BuildNavigationXml to parse the YAML configuration, LoadNavigationUI to generate the complete navigation structure, and helper methods like GetChildItems and AddFolder that build the navigation hierarchy.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 56`: Permission checking that supports complex boolean expressions for access control
- `Line 91`: Uses YAML for configuration that gets converted to XML for processing
- `Line 124`: Builds a hierarchical navigation structure with internationalization support via label tokens
- `Line 149`: Dynamically checks if HTML files exist for navigation items to determine implementation status
