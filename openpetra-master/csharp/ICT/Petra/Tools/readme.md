# C# Petra Tools Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a C# application that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements core utility functions and shared components along with specialized tools that support the main application architecture. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Cross-cutting utility functions for data manipulation and validation
- Specialized tools for currency exchange and international transactions
- Configuration management and system integration components
- Reusable UI components and data presentation helpers
  - Form generation and validation
  - Internationalization support

## Identified Design Elements

1. **International Financial Processing**: Tools for handling multi-currency transactions, exchange rates, and clearing house operations to minimize currency exchange charges
2. **Data Export/Import Framework**: Components that facilitate data interchange with external systems in various formats
3. **Contact Management Utilities**: Helper classes for managing organization and individual contact information
4. **Publication and Label Generation**: Tools for generating reports, publications, and physical labels
5. **Configuration Management**: Utilities for managing application settings across different deployment environments

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation between business logic and presentation layers. The tools subproject provides reusable components that can be leveraged across the main application, ensuring consistency in data handling, validation, and user interface presentation. The design emphasizes extensibility to accommodate new features while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations. The tools are designed to support both web-based and desktop interfaces, with appropriate abstractions to handle the differences between these environments.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Tools/FinanceGDPdUExport

The program handles accounting, contact management, and data export functions while supporting international operations. This sub-project implements German tax authority digital data access (GDPdU) export functionality along with comprehensive financial data extraction capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized financial data export for German tax compliance
- Transaction data extraction with proper debit/credit indicators and tax calculations
- Accounts payable document export including payments and supplier details
- Cost center and account information formatting for audit purposes
- General ledger balance reporting with period start/end values
- Participant and gift transaction data extraction for conference/seminar reporting

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Command-Line Interface Architecture**: The main export tool connects to the Petra server and orchestrates the export of various financial data components
2. **Modular Export Components**: Separate specialized classes handle different aspects of financial data (transactions, accounts payable, balances, etc.)
3. **Configurable Filtering System**: Exports can be filtered by cost centers, accounts, transaction references, and financial years
4. **Database Query Optimization**: SQL queries are constructed to efficiently retrieve and join complex financial data from multiple tables
5. **Standardized Output Formatting**: All exports follow consistent CSV formatting with proper encoding for German tax authority requirements

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes compliance with German tax reporting requirements while providing flexible data extraction capabilities. The modular design separates concerns by financial data type, with each component handling its specific database interactions and formatting requirements. The system supports multi-year exports and implements sophisticated filtering to include only relevant financial information. All exports maintain consistent CSV formatting with appropriate character encoding to ensure compatibility with tax authority systems.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Tools/SampleDataConstructor

This subproject implements automated data generation for all major functional areas of OpenPetra, creating realistic test environments without manual data entry. The constructor creates interconnected partner, financial, and operational records that reflect real-world usage patterns of the OpenPetra system.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated generation of complete test datasets from CSV templates
- Creation of realistic partner hierarchies including families, organizations, banks, and field units
- Population of financial systems with ledgers, transactions, gift batches, and invoices
- Establishment of proper relational connections between all generated entities
  - Partner relationships and hierarchies
  - Financial transactions linked to appropriate accounts and partners

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Modular Data Generation**: Each functional area has dedicated generator classes that handle specific entity types while maintaining referential integrity
2. **CSV-Based Input**: Uses Benerator-created CSV files as source data, allowing for controlled randomization and realistic data patterns
3. **Transactional Processing**: Ensures database consistency by using OpenPetra's existing data access layer and transaction management
4. **Progressive Data Building**: Constructs data in a logical sequence where dependent entities are created after their prerequisites

#### Overview
The architecture follows a command-line interface pattern where the main Program class orchestrates the generation process by invoking specialized generator classes for each data domain. These generators (Workers, Donors, Organizations, Banks, Ledgers, GiftBatches, AccountsPayable) create appropriate database records through OpenPetra's standard data access interfaces, ensuring that all business rules and data integrity constraints are respected. The system is designed for repeatability and can generate consistent datasets for testing while supporting variable parameters for different testing scenarios.

### csharp/ICT/Petra/Tools/YmlGzImportExport

The program handles financial transactions and contact management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements database backup and restoration functionality using compressed YAML files, providing a command-line interface for database operations. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Database export to compressed YAML (.yml.gz) files
- Database import/restoration from compressed YAML files
- Command-line interface for automation and scripting
- Integration with OpenPetra's server connection infrastructure

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Command-Line Interface: Processes arguments to determine operation mode (dump/load) and target file paths
2. Environment Initialization: Sets up the necessary application environment for database operations
3. Server Connection Management: Handles connections to the OpenPetra database server
4. Compression Integration: Implements GZip compression to reduce backup file sizes
5. Web Connector Integration: Coordinates with TImportExportWebConnector for actual data operations

#### Overview
The architecture follows a straightforward command-line utility pattern, focusing on two primary operations: database export (DumpYmlGz) and import (LoadYmlGz). The tool initializes the application environment, establishes server connections, and delegates the actual data operations to the TImportExportWebConnector. This design allows for easy integration with automated backup systems and provides a reliable method for database migration and backup in OpenPetra deployments. The compressed YAML format balances human readability with efficient storage.
