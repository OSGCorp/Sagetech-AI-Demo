# C# Petra System Of Petra

The Petra system is a C# application designed to provide administrative and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The system implements a comprehensive web-based platform with client-server architecture, utilizing .NET Core for backend processing and Bootstrap for responsive frontend interfaces. This sub-project implements the core business logic and data processing components along with the web service interfaces that expose functionality to clients. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Multi-tenant data management with organization-specific configurations
- Financial transaction processing with multi-currency support
- International clearing house functionality for minimizing currency exchange fees
- Extensible contact and relationship management system
- Document generation and reporting services

## Identified Design Elements

1. Service-Oriented Architecture: Core business logic is exposed through well-defined service interfaces that abstract underlying data operations
2. Repository Pattern Implementation: Data access is managed through repositories that provide a clean separation between business logic and database operations
3. Multi-currency Support: Built-in handling for currency conversion, exchange rates, and international financial transactions
4. Modular Design: Functionality is organized into discrete modules (accounting, contact management, sponsorship) that can be enabled or disabled per deployment
5. Internationalization Framework: Support for multiple languages and regional formatting throughout the application

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes scalability and configurability to support organizations of varying sizes and needs. The system provides both UI-driven workflows and API endpoints for integration with other systems. The codebase follows SOLID principles with dependency injection for testability and maintainability. Data validation occurs at multiple levels to ensure integrity, while the reporting engine allows for customizable output formats including PDF, CSV, and Excel.
