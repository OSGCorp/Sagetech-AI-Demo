# C# Server Admin Core Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# application that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the server administration core functionality along with client-server communication interfaces for remote management operations. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Remote server management and monitoring
- Database administration operations (backup, restore, upgrade)
- User account management
- Server operational controls
- Client connection management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Client-Server Communication Layer**: Implements proxy classes that facilitate remote server management through HTTP requests
2. **Comprehensive Server Monitoring**: Provides methods to retrieve server state, version information, and memory usage statistics
3. **Database Management Interface**: Encapsulates complex database operations behind a simplified API
4. **User Management System**: Handles user creation and credential management securely
5. **Operational Control Interface**: Allows for remote server control including shutdown and garbage collection

## Overview
The architecture follows a client-proxy pattern where the `TMServerAdminNamespace` class contains methods that construct parameter lists and forward calls to the server-side web connectors. This design maintains a clean separation between client and server concerns while providing a comprehensive API for server administration. The implementation emphasizes security and robustness for critical operations like database management and user administration, while offering monitoring capabilities essential for operational maintenance.

## Business Functions

### Server Administration
- `ClientGlue.MServerAdmin.cs` : Client-side glue code for server administration operations in OpenPetra, providing remote method calls to the server.

## Files
### ClientGlue.MServerAdmin.cs

ClientGlue.MServerAdmin.cs implements client-side proxy classes for OpenPetra's server administration functionality. It defines the TMServerAdminNamespace class containing TServerAdminWebConnectorsNamespace, which provides methods for remote server management operations. The file implements numerous methods that forward calls to the server via HTTP, including functions to get server information (version, state, memory usage), manage clients (list, disconnect), perform database operations (backup, restore, upgrade), handle user management (add users, set passwords), and control server operations (stop server, garbage collection). Each method constructs parameter lists and invokes the appropriate server-side web connector.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: Main namespace structure that mirrors the server-side organization for remote method access
- `Line 75`: HTTP connector pattern used to forward method calls to server-side implementations
- `Line 181`: Method overloading with different parameter signatures for the AddUser functionality
