# C# Server Admin Applications Subproject Of OpenPetra

The C# Server Admin Applications subproject provides the web-based administrative interface for OpenPetra, implemented as a set of ASP.NET MVC controllers and views. This subproject serves as the bridge between the OpenPetra server's business logic and the browser-based user interface, delivering both interactive HTML interfaces and programmatic JSON APIs from the same codebase. The architecture follows a controller-based pattern where each functional area is represented by dedicated controllers that handle specific administrative domains.

The subproject implements these core capabilities:

- Dynamic form generation based on data model introspection
- Dual-mode response handling (HTML for browsers, JSON for API clients)
- Widget-based UI composition for complex screens
- Session management and authentication services
- Internationalization support for the administrative interface

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Controller Inheritance Pattern**: Controllers inherit from base classes that provide common functionality like authentication, session management, and response formatting
2. **View Model Transformation**: Data objects from the business layer are transformed into view-specific models to separate presentation concerns
3. **Partial View Composition**: Complex screens are built from reusable partial views that can be independently maintained
4. **Client-Side Integration**: Server-rendered views include JavaScript hooks for enhanced client-side functionality
5. **Permission-Based Access Control**: Administrative functions are protected by a granular permission system that controls access at the action level

## Overview
The architecture follows modern ASP.NET MVC patterns while providing backward compatibility with legacy OpenPetra components. Controllers are organized by functional domain (accounting, contacts, etc.) with shared functionality extracted to base classes. The view layer leverages Bootstrap for responsive design while maintaining OpenPetra's established UI conventions. This subproject serves as the primary administrative interface for system operators and administrators.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Petra/ServerAdmin/app/Core

The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the server administration core functionality along with client-server communication interfaces for remote management operations. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Remote server management and monitoring
- Database administration operations (backup, restore, upgrade)
- User account management
- Server operational controls
- Client connection management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Client-Server Communication Layer**: Implements proxy classes that facilitate remote server management through HTTP requests
2. **Comprehensive Server Monitoring**: Provides methods to retrieve server state, version information, and memory usage statistics
3. **Database Management Interface**: Encapsulates complex database operations behind a simplified API
4. **User Management System**: Handles user creation and credential management securely
5. **Operational Control Interface**: Allows for remote server control including shutdown and garbage collection

#### Overview
The architecture follows a client-proxy pattern where the `TMServerAdminNamespace` class contains methods that construct parameter lists and forward calls to the server-side web connectors. This design maintains a clean separation between client and server concerns while providing a comprehensive API for server administration. The implementation emphasizes security and robustness for critical operations like database management and user administration, while offering monitoring capabilities essential for operational maintenance.
