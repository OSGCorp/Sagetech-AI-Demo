# C# Shared Conference Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational data across multiple domains. This sub-project implements the core conference management data structures and constants along with type definitions that support conference operations throughout the system. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized conference data structures through typed datasets
- Conference application status tracking and management
- Field reporting categorization through unit type enumerations
- Cross-module conference data integration with partner and venue information

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Typed Dataset Architecture**: Three primary datasets (SelectConferenceTDS, ConferenceSetupTDS, and ConferenceApplicationTDS) provide structured data access patterns for different conference management functions
2. **Standardized Constants**: Centralized definition of application types and statuses ensures consistency across the conference module
3. **Enumeration-Based Categorization**: The TUnitTypeEnum provides a type-safe way to categorize different field types for reporting purposes
4. **Relational Data Integration**: Conference data structures maintain relationships with partner, venue, and person data, enabling comprehensive application management

## Overview
The architecture establishes a foundation for conference management within OpenPetra through well-defined data structures and constants. The module supports the full lifecycle of conference management from setup and configuration to application processing and reporting. By maintaining clear relationships between conferences, venues, applications, and attendees, the system enables non-profit organizations to efficiently manage conference operations while integrating with the broader partner management and financial capabilities of OpenPetra.

## Business Functions

### Conference Management
- `Constants.cs` : Defines constants for the conference module in OpenPetra's shared library.
- `Types.cs` : Defines enumeration types for conference field reports in the OpenPetra system.
- `data/ConferenceTypedDataSets.xml` : XML definition of typed datasets for conference management in OpenPetra.

## Files
### Constants.cs

MConferenceConstants defines a small set of constants used throughout the conference module of OpenPetra. The class contains two public string constants: APPTYPE_CONFERENCE which defines the application type as 'CONFERENCE', and APPSTATUS_ONHOLD which represents an application status of 'H' for applications that are on hold and being processed. These constants provide standardized values for the conference management functionality.
### Types.cs

This file defines the TUnitTypeEnum enumeration used in the conference management module of OpenPetra. The enumeration specifies different types of units that should be returned to conference field reports, including charged fields, sending fields, receiving fields, registering fields, and outreach options. Each enumeration value represents a specific category of fields related to conference management, helping to classify and organize conference data for reporting purposes. The file is part of the MConference namespace within the Ict.Petra.Shared module.
### data/ConferenceTypedDataSets.xml

This XML file defines three typed datasets for the conference management module in OpenPetra: SelectConferenceTDS, ConferenceSetupTDS, and ConferenceApplicationTDS. Each dataset specifies SQL tables and fields needed for different conference operations. SelectConferenceTDS links partner and conference tables for basic selection. ConferenceSetupTDS includes tables for conference configuration, venues, options, and discounts. ConferenceApplicationTDS combines partner, person, application, and attendee tables for managing conference applications.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 6-9`: The dataset structure imports multiple modules showing cross-module dependencies between Conference, Personnel and Partner systems.
- `Line 17`: Field mapping between tables where VenueName is mapped from p_venue table rather than the primary table of the definition.
