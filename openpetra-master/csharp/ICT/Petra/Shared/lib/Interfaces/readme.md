# C# Shared Interfaces Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a C# application that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. This sub-project implements the core interface definitions that enable plugin-based extensibility and standardized communication between system components. The C# Shared Interfaces establish the contract-based architecture that allows OpenPetra to maintain loose coupling while supporting features like external authentication systems and modular component integration.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Standardized authentication interfaces for plugin-based user verification
- Namespace dependency management across the application
- Contract definitions for cross-module communication
- Extension points for implementing custom authentication providers (LDAP, etc.)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Plugin Architecture**: The interfaces define extension points that allow third-party implementations to integrate with core OpenPetra functionality
2. **Authentication Abstraction**: IUserAuthentication interface provides a consistent API for different authentication mechanisms
3. **Namespace Management**: Structured YAML configuration controls interface dependencies across the application
4. **Modular Design**: Interfaces are organized by functional domains (Common, Finance, Partner, etc.)

## Overview
The architecture follows a contract-first design approach where interfaces define clear boundaries between system components. This enables the development of loosely coupled modules that can evolve independently while maintaining compatibility through stable interface contracts. The authentication plugin system demonstrates this approach by allowing OpenPetra to support various authentication mechanisms without modifying core application code.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `InterfacesUsingNamespaces.yml` : Configuration file mapping interface namespaces to required project namespaces for OpenPetra.

### Authentication
- `SysMan.Plugins.cs` : Defines the IUserAuthentication interface for OpenPetra's plugin-based user authentication system.

## Files
### InterfacesUsingNamespaces.yml

This YAML configuration file defines namespace dependencies for various interfaces in the OpenPetra project. It specifies which project namespaces need to be added as using statements for each interface, ensuring proper references are established. The file organizes these dependencies into sections for different modules including Common, Conference, Finance, Partner, Personnel, SysMan, Reporting, and Sponsorship. Each section lists the specific Ict.Petra.Shared namespaces required by that interface, which would otherwise need to be manually added in interface files.
### SysMan.Plugins.cs

SysMan.Plugins.cs defines the IUserAuthentication interface that enables plugin-based authentication mechanisms for OpenPetra. This interface allows the system to authenticate users against external systems like LDAP servers or other applications. The interface includes methods for authenticating users with username/password combinations, changing passwords (both by administrators and users themselves), creating new users, and querying which authentication features are supported by the implementing plugin. Key methods include AuthenticateUser(), SetPassword(), CreateUser(), and GetAuthenticationFunctionality().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 37`: The interface design enables OpenPetra to support multiple authentication backends through a plugin architecture
- `Line 62`: GetAuthenticationFunctionality method allows plugins to declare their capabilities, enabling the system to adapt its UI accordingly
