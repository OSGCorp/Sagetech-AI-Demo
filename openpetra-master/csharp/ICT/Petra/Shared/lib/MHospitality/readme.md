# C# Shared Hospitality Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational resources through a modular architecture. This sub-project implements the hospitality management functionality along with the underlying data structures that support accommodation and resource allocation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Facility management for buildings and rooms
- Resource allocation and booking system
- Attribute-based room classification and filtering
- Temporal management of accommodations and reservations

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Strongly-Typed Data Structure**: The module uses TypedDataSets to ensure type safety and provide compile-time checking for hospitality data operations
2. **Relational Data Model**: Implements relationships between buildings, rooms, bookings, and allocations through a well-defined schema
3. **Attribute System**: Flexible room classification through attributes allows for dynamic filtering and categorization
4. **Temporal Resource Management**: Handles time-based allocation of resources with booking start/end date tracking

## Overview
The architecture follows a data-centric design where the TypedDataSet definition serves as the foundation for all hospitality operations. This approach ensures data integrity while providing a clear interface between the data layer and business logic. The module integrates with other OpenPetra components through imported data structures, maintaining consistency across the application. The hospitality module is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional attributes and booking types to be added as organizational needs evolve.

## Business Functions

### Hospitality Data Structure
- `data/Hospitality.TypedDataSets.xml` : Defines the HospitalityTDS TypedDataSet structure for OpenPetra's hospitality management module.

## Files
### data/Hospitality.TypedDataSets.xml

HospitalityTDS TypedDataSet XML definition specifies the data structure for OpenPetra's hospitality management functionality. It imports related data modules and defines a dataset that includes tables for buildings, rooms, room allocations, room attributes, bookings, and room bookings. This file serves as a schema definition that will be used to generate strongly-typed dataset classes for the hospitality module, connecting the data layer with business logic.
