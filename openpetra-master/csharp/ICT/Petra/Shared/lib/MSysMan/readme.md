## C# Shared System Management Module of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra Shared System Management Module is a C# component that provides core system administration and user management functionality for the OpenPetra platform. This module implements the foundational data structures and constants required for user management, permissions, and system-wide configuration settings. It serves as the backbone for authentication, authorization, and user preference management across the application.

This module provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- User account and group management data structures
- Permission and access control definitions
- System-wide configuration constants
- User preference storage and retrieval
- Module-specific default settings management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Typed Dataset Architecture**: Strongly-typed datasets provide a structured approach to user and permission data management with built-in validation
2. **Modular Configuration System**: Constants organized by functional area allow for centralized management of system settings
3. **Hierarchical Permission Model**: Multi-level permissions system spanning users, groups, modules, and tables
4. **User Preference Framework**: Standardized approach to storing and retrieving user-specific settings across all modules
5. **Cross-Module Integration**: The system management module interfaces with partner management, finance, and other modules through well-defined constants

## Overview
The architecture follows a data-centric approach with clear separation between data structures and constants. The typed datasets provide a strongly-typed interface to the underlying database tables, while the constants system offers a centralized repository for configuration values. This design facilitates consistent access to system settings and user preferences throughout the application, particularly for modules with numerous configurable options like partner management.

## Business Functions

### System Management
- `Constants.cs` : Defines constants used throughout the MSysMan module for user defaults and system configuration.
- `data/SysMan.TypedDataSets.xml` : Defines the typed dataset structure for user management in the OpenPetra system.

## Files
### Constants.cs

MSysManConstants defines a collection of string constants used throughout the OpenPetra system manager module. It primarily contains user default constants for various modules including general Petra settings, partner management, and finance reporting. The constants define keys for storing user preferences such as UI language, display settings, search criteria configurations, and recently accessed partners. These constants enable consistent access to configuration values across the application, particularly for the partner management module which has numerous configurable options for search behavior, display preferences, and default values.
### data/SysMan.TypedDataSets.xml

This XML file defines the MaintainUsersTDS typed dataset structure for the system management module in OpenPetra. It specifies database tables related to user management, including s_user, s_module, s_group, s_user_group, and various permission tables for module and table access. The dataset connects to the Ict.Petra.Shared.MSysMan.Data namespace and provides the schema for managing user accounts, groups, and their associated permissions within the OpenPetra system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Defines a typed dataset that will be used to generate strongly-typed C# classes for data access
