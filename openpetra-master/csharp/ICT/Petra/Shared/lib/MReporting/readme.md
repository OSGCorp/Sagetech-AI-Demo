## C# Shared Reporting Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational data across multiple domains. This sub-project implements the shared reporting infrastructure along with parameter management for report generation. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Flexible parameter management with hierarchical organization
- Type-safe parameter handling for various data types (Boolean, Decimal, String, DateTime, Int32)
- Parameter lookup with configurable fit strategies
- Report column layout and dimension management
- Serialization support for parameter data to/from JSON format

## Identified Design Elements

1. Hierarchical Parameter Organization: Parameters are stored with column and level attributes, enabling structured organization of reporting values
2. Flexible Parameter Lookup: Multiple fit strategies (exact, best fit, all columns) allow for precise or approximate parameter matching
3. Type Safety: Strong typing for parameters ensures data integrity throughout the reporting pipeline
4. Serialization Support: Built-in JSON serialization facilitates data exchange between system components
5. Column Management: Dedicated classes for handling report column layouts and dimensions

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes flexibility through its parameter management system, providing a foundation for OpenPetra's reporting capabilities. The module is designed for maintainability with clear separation between parameter handling and column management. While the TResultList component is marked for removal, the parameter infrastructure is robust and well-structured. The module serves as a critical bridge between data sources and report presentation, enabling non-profit organizations to generate meaningful insights from their operational data.

## Business Functions

### Reporting Parameters
- `Parameter.cs` : Provides parameter management for OpenPetra reporting system with hierarchical column and level-based value storage.

### Legacy Components
- `Result.cs` : A placeholder class in the MReporting namespace that is marked for future removal.

## Files
### Parameter.cs

TParameterList implements a flexible parameter management system for OpenPetra's reporting functionality. It stores named parameters with column and level attributes, allowing hierarchical organization of values. The class provides methods for adding, retrieving, and manipulating parameters of various data types (Boolean, Decimal, String, DateTime, Int32). Key functionality includes parameter lookup with different fit strategies (exact, best fit, all columns), serialization to/from JSON, and copying parameters between lists. The file also defines TParameter for individual parameter storage, eParameterFit enum for lookup strategies, and TColumnSettingCollection/TColumnSetting classes for managing report column layouts and dimensions.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 146`: Implements IComparable interface for sorting parameters by name, level, and column
- `Line 319`: GetParameter method implements sophisticated hierarchical lookup with multiple fallback strategies
- `Line 469`: JSON serialization/deserialization for parameter persistence
- `Line 557`: ConvertToFormattedStrings creates a copy with locale-specific date formatting
### Result.cs

TResultList is a placeholder class in the Ict.Petra.Shared.MReporting namespace that is explicitly marked for removal soon. The file contains minimal code - just the class declaration with no implementation details, methods, or properties. The file includes standard copyright notices and license information for OpenPetra.org, indicating it's part of the free and open-source OpenPetra system governed by the GNU General Public License.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 28`: Class is explicitly marked for removal with a summary comment indicating it will be removed soon
