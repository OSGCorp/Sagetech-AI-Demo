# C# Filter Button Wiki Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management solutions for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational contacts. This sub-project implements automated UI analysis tooling along with documentation generation for filter/find functionality across the application's screens. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated identification of screens requiring filter functionality
- Template-based categorization of UI components
- Documentation generation in wiki format
- Mantis issue tracking integration

## Identified Design Elements

1. YAML UI Definition Analysis: Scans client-side YAML files to identify screens with or without filter/find functionality
2. Template Categorization System: Classifies screens by template type to determine appropriate filter implementation requirements
3. Metadata-Driven Documentation: Uses XML metadata to track special cases and implementation notes
4. Issue Tracking Integration: Maps UI components to Mantis feature requests for development tracking

## Overview
The architecture focuses on development support through automated analysis of the OpenPetra UI definition files. The tool generates comprehensive reports that help developers identify which screens need filter/find functionality implementation, which already have it, and tracks this against the issue management system. The metadata-driven approach allows for special case handling and provides a centralized reference for UI component implementation status. This tooling supports consistent UI behavior across the application while maintaining clear documentation of implementation status.

## Business Functions

### Documentation
- `wiki.metadata.xml` : XML metadata file for the FilterButtonWiki tool that tracks screens with filter functionality and Mantis issue references.

### Analysis Tools
- `Program.cs` : A utility tool that analyzes YAML UI files to identify screens needing filter/find functionality and generates a wiki report.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program implements a utility tool that analyzes OpenPetra's YAML UI definition files to identify screens requiring filter/find functionality implementation. It scans client-side YAML files, categorizes them by template type, and checks for UI elements like grids, details panels, and button panels. The tool generates a wiki-formatted report showing which screens have filter/find functionality, which need it, and tracks related Mantis bug cases. Key functionality includes file scanning, template categorization, and detailed reporting with statistics. Important elements include the Main method, CheckForIssues methods, and various static lists that track different template types and UI components.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 32-42`: The program categorizes YAML files into 11 different template types using static lists, showing the system's UI architecture organization
- `Line 76-144`: The CheckForIssues method analyzes YAML files for specific UI components and generates wiki-formatted tables with color-coded status indicators
- `Line 146-198`: The method parses YAML and manual code files to detect implementation patterns and cross-references with Mantis bug tracking system
- `Line 263-269`: Comprehensive statistics generation summarizes findings across all screens, showing implementation status and tracking progress
- `Line 270-307`: Tracks and reports on Mantis bug cases, showing which are fixed, open, or not yet assigned to screens
### wiki.metadata.xml

This XML metadata file for the FilterButtonWiki tool contains two main sections: 'comments' and 'mantis'. The comments section identifies YAML screen files that either have special filter panel implementations or don't require filter functionality, with explanatory notes. The mantis section maps YAML screen files to their corresponding Mantis feature request numbers, organized by modules (Common, Finance, Partner, Personnel, and Sysman). Additionally, it includes a 'featurenoscreen' section listing Mantis features that don't have corresponding screens in OpenPetra.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3-16`: Comments section uses styling attributes to visually highlight screens that won't have filter functionality
- `Line 19-88`: Mantis section organizes feature requests by module categories for tracking implementation status
- `Line 91-121`: Lists Mantis features without corresponding screens, showing legacy or planned functionality
