# C# Delete Button Wiki Of Petra

The Petra is a C# program that provides administrative management for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational data. This sub-project implements automated analysis of delete functionality implementation across the codebase along with documentation generation for delete operations. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Static code analysis of delete button implementation patterns
- Validation of proper reference counting mechanisms
- Identification of inconsistencies between client and server table names
- Automated documentation generation for delete operations
  - Highlights screens with potential implementation issues
  - Identifies patterns of delete functionality usage

## Identified Design Elements

1. YAML Configuration Analysis: Parses screen definition files to identify templates and their delete button implementations
2. Pattern Recognition: Identifies standard delete implementation approaches (auto vs. manual) across the codebase
3. Reference Integrity Validation: Verifies proper reference counting mechanisms are in place for data deletion
4. Documentation Generation: Produces wiki-style reports showing delete button implementation status across screens

## Overview
The architecture focuses on ensuring data integrity by validating proper delete operation implementations throughout the OpenPetra application. It analyzes both auto-generated and manually created code to identify potential issues in delete functionality. The tool helps maintain consistency in how data deletion is handled across different screens and modules, providing developers with a comprehensive view of delete button implementations and highlighting areas that may need attention or improvement.

## Business Functions

### Build & Deployment Tools
- `Program.cs` : A build tool that analyzes OpenPetra screens for Delete button implementation issues and generates a wiki report.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program.cs implements a build tool that analyzes YAML, manual, and auto-generated files in the OpenPetra suite to identify issues with Delete button functionality implementation. It examines screens based on various templates (like WindowEdit, WindowMaintainTable) and checks for proper implementation of delete operations, including reference counting, deletable flags, and client/server table name matching. The tool generates a formatted wiki-style report showing which screens have New/Delete buttons, whether they use auto-delete or manual delete functions, and highlights potential issues with yellow background. Key functionality includes parsing YAML files to identify screen templates, checking for proper delete implementation patterns, and generating a comprehensive report with statistics about delete button usage across the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: The program categorizes OpenPetra screens by their template types using lists that store YAML file paths
- `Line 138`: Implements a comprehensive check for proper delete button implementation across multiple dimensions
- `Line 339`: Verifies client/server table name matching by checking reference count files for proper implementation
- `Line 393`: Uses color coding in the output to distinguish between intentional design choices and potential issues
- `Line 485`: Custom YAML attribute parser extracts values from YAML files without using a full YAML parser
