# C# Developer's Assistant Updater Of Petra

The Petra application is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. It handles contact management, accounting, sponsorship, and data export functionality. This sub-project implements an automated update mechanism for the Developer's Assistant component of Petra, ensuring seamless version transitions without manual intervention.

The C# Developer's Assistant Updater provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Automated file replacement during application downtime
- Intelligent process management (waiting for application shutdown)
- Targeted file copying for executables and debugging symbols
- Application relaunch after successful updates
- Comprehensive logging of update operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Process Monitoring: The updater monitors the target application's process state to determine when it's safe to perform updates
2. Configurable Deployment: Uses command-line arguments to specify target paths, making it adaptable to different environments
3. Selective File Updating: Focuses on critical application files (executables and PDB files) to minimize update time
4. Error Handling: Implements robust error handling with appropriate user feedback and logging
5. Application Lifecycle Management: Handles the complete update cycle from shutdown detection through to application restart

## Overview
The architecture follows a straightforward procedural approach focused on reliability and minimal disruption. The updater operates as a standalone utility that can be triggered externally, making it suitable for integration with CI/CD pipelines or manual update processes. Its design prioritizes operational reliability over complex features, ensuring that the critical task of updating application files is performed consistently and safely.

## Business Functions

### Application Update Utility
- `Program.cs` : A utility program that updates the Developers Assistant application by copying files from the delivery/bin directory to a specified location.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program implements a utility for updating application files by copying them from a source to a target location. It specifically handles the Developers Assistant application but is designed to be adaptable. The main functionality includes waiting for the target application to shut down, copying the executable and PDB files to the specified location, logging the operation results, and relaunching the updated application. The program uses command-line arguments to determine the target path and displays success/failure messages. Key methods include Main() which handles the entire update process including file copying, error handling, and logging.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 50`: The application waits 4 seconds for the existing application to shut down before attempting the file copy operation
- `Line 59`: The program attempts to copy both the executable and PDB files for debugging support
- `Line 123`: The updater relaunches the target application with a command line parameter indicating success or failure
