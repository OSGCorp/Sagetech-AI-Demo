# C# Data Migration Statistics Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management tools for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and contact management while reducing operational overhead. This sub-project implements data migration verification capabilities along with statistical analysis of migration completeness. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Database migration integrity validation
- Quantitative assessment of migration success rates
- Automated comparison between expected and actual data volumes
- Detailed reporting of migration discrepancies

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Database Schema Awareness**: Connects to the database and understands the Petra XML schema structure to verify appropriate tables
2. **Configuration-Driven Verification**: Uses external configuration files (_row_count.txt) to define expected data volumes
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates and reports migration completeness as percentage metrics
4. **Discrepancy Identification**: Pinpoints specific tables with incomplete or inconsistent migration results

## Overview
The architecture follows a straightforward utility design pattern, focusing on reliability and accuracy in migration verification. The tool operates independently as a command-line utility that can be integrated into deployment pipelines or run manually. It provides both detailed table-level diagnostics and high-level statistical summaries of migration success. This verification layer ensures data integrity when moving between environments or during system upgrades, serving as a critical quality assurance component for the broader OpenPetra application.

## Business Functions

### Data Migration Verification
- `Program.cs` : Utility tool that verifies data migration success by comparing actual database row counts against expected values.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program implements a utility tool for OpenPetra that verifies data migration completeness by comparing actual database row counts against expected values stored in a _row_count.txt file. It connects to the database, retrieves the actual row count for each table defined in the Petra XML schema, and compares these counts with the expected values. The tool reports any discrepancies, identifies incomplete tables, and provides statistics on the overall migration success rate as a percentage. Key functions include Main(), which orchestrates the entire verification process by reading configuration, connecting to the database, and performing the comparison.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 30`: Uses a configuration file to determine the location of the row count file, making the tool adaptable to different environments
- `Line 42`: Parses the Petra XML schema definition to dynamically determine which tables to check rather than hardcoding table names
- `Line 49`: Implements a simple but effective file format with alternating lines for table names and row counts
- `Line 60`: Specifically excludes the s_login table from verification as its row count changes with each database connection
