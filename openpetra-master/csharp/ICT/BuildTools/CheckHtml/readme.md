# C# HTML Checker Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational data. This sub-project implements HTML validation tooling along with quality control for the OpenPetra js-client forms. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated validation of HTML structure in js-client forms
- Detection of modal component requirements (header, body, footer)
- Prevention of ID conflicts by identifying improper 'for' attributes in labels
- Recursive processing of all HTML files in specified directories

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Command-Line Interface**: Provides a utility that can be integrated into build processes or run manually to ensure HTML quality
2. **Regex-Based Validation**: Uses pattern matching to identify structural issues without requiring a full HTML parser
3. **Content Normalization**: Removes whitespace and standardizes HTML content for consistent analysis
4. **Recursive Directory Processing**: Automatically handles nested folder structures to validate all relevant files

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes quality control through automated validation, ensuring consistent structure across the js-client forms. The tool helps maintain the integrity of the OpenPetra UI by preventing common issues that could cause rendering problems or functional conflicts. By validating HTML during development or build processes, it reduces the likelihood of UI-related bugs reaching production environments.

## Business Functions

### HTML Validation Tools
- `Program.cs` : Command-line tool that validates HTML files in the OpenPetra js-client forms directory for proper structure and formatting.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program implements a command-line utility that checks HTML files in the OpenPetra js-client forms directory for compliance with specific structural requirements. It validates that edit windows contain required modal components (header, body, footer) and ensures labels don't use the 'for' attribute which could cause ID conflicts with phantom objects. The tool recursively processes all HTML files in the specified directory, normalizes content by removing whitespace, and reports any violations. Key methods include Main() for command-line processing and CheckHTML() which performs the actual validation using regex patterns.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 78`: Removes all whitespace from HTML before analysis to simplify pattern matching
- `Line 82`: Specifically checks for 'tpl_edit' which indicates an editable window requiring specific modal components
- `Line 93`: Uses regex to detect problematic 'for' attributes in labels that would conflict with phantom objects
