## C# Tiny Web Server Subproject Of OpenPetra

The C# Tiny Web Server is a lightweight HTTP server implementation that provides web hosting capabilities for OpenPetra when Mono's XSP server is unavailable. This subproject consists of two core components: a threaded HTTP listener wrapper and a specialized worker request handler. The server enables OpenPetra to expose its ASMX web services and web interfaces without requiring external web server dependencies.

The architecture is designed for efficiency and simplicity, with these key capabilities:

- Multi-threaded request processing for concurrent connections
- Configurable port binding and runtime parameters
- Comprehensive HTTP request/response handling
- Virtual-to-physical path translation for web resources
- Integrated logging system for diagnostics

## Identified Design Elements

1. **ThreadedHttpListenerWrapper**: Manages the core HTTP listener instance, spawning worker threads for each incoming connection to maintain responsiveness
2. **TMyHttpWorkerRequest**: Extends the standard HttpWorkerRequest to process web requests, handling headers, request data, and response output
3. **Command-line Configuration**: Supports runtime parameters for port selection, log file location, and maximum execution time
4. **Application Host Integration**: Configures and initializes the ASP.NET application host to process web requests within the OpenPetra environment

## Overview
The architecture prioritizes lightweight operation while providing full HTTP server capabilities. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for more complex web servers when needed, maintaining compatibility with OpenPetra's web service requirements. The implementation balances simplicity with the necessary features to support OpenPetra's administrative web interfaces and API endpoints.

## Business Functions

### Web Server Components
- `HttpListener.cs` : Implements a lightweight HTTP server with threading support for handling web requests in the OpenPetra build tools.
- `Program.cs` : A simple ASMX web server implementation for OpenPetra when Mono's XSP server is unavailable.

## Files
### HttpListener.cs

HttpListener.cs implements a lightweight HTTP server with two main classes: ThreadedHttpListenerWrapper and TMyHttpWorkerRequest. The wrapper class manages an HttpListener instance that handles multiple concurrent requests by spawning a new thread for each incoming connection. It provides methods to configure, start, stop, and process HTTP requests. The TMyHttpWorkerRequest class extends HttpWorkerRequest to handle web requests including ASMX services, implementing numerous required methods for HTTP communication such as handling headers, processing request data, managing response output, and translating between virtual and physical paths.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Creates a new thread for each incoming HTTP request, allowing concurrent processing
- `Line 112`: Custom implementation of HttpWorkerRequest enables ASP.NET processing within a lightweight server
- `Line 329`: Special handling for both ASPX and ASMX file paths, supporting web services
- `Line 345`: Path translation logic converts between virtual and physical paths for proper file handling
### Program.cs

TTinyASMXServer implements a lightweight web server for hosting ASMX services in OpenPetra when Mono's XSP server isn't available. It creates an HTTP listener on a specified port, configures an application host, and processes incoming requests. The server supports command-line parameters for port number, log file location, and maximum runtime. Key functionality includes logging, thread management for runtime limits, and application hosting. Important methods include Main(), Log(), ThreadCheckMaxRunTime(), and ProcessRequest(). The class manages variables for server state, logging, and configuration.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 73`: Thread monitoring system to automatically stop the server after a configured maximum runtime
- `Line 110`: Creates application directory structure and copies the executing assembly to ensure proper hosting
- `Line 123`: Uses ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost to set up ASP.NET hosting environment
- `Line 142`: Provides instructions for configuring URL ACLs when permission issues occur
