# C# ICT Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and organizational data management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements the International Clearing House (ICT) functionality along with the supporting data structures and processing logic. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Cross-currency transaction management
- International payment clearing and reconciliation
- Multi-organization financial data exchange
- Automated currency conversion and fee calculation
  - Exchange rate application
  - Transaction fee management

## Identified Design Elements

1. Transaction Processing Pipeline: A structured workflow for handling international transactions from initiation through clearing and settlement
2. Currency Management System: Handles exchange rates, conversion calculations, and fee structures across multiple currencies
3. Organization Interface Layer: Provides standardized communication protocols between participating organizations
4. Audit and Compliance Framework: Ensures all transactions are properly tracked, documented and compliant with international regulations

## Overview
The ICT architecture follows a modular design that separates transaction processing, currency management, and organizational interfaces. It implements robust validation at each processing stage to ensure data integrity across international boundaries. The system minimizes currency exchange costs through intelligent routing and batching of transactions. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through clear separation of concerns between financial logic, data persistence, and the API layer that serves both internal OpenPetra components and external organizational systems.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/BuildTools

This subproject implements automated build processes and dependency management along with continuous integration support. The build tools provide these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated build pipeline configuration
- Dependency resolution and package management
- Cross-platform build support (Windows, Linux)
- Test automation infrastructure
- Deployment packaging and configuration

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **MSBuild Integration**: Custom MSBuild tasks and targets that extend the standard build process for OpenPetra-specific requirements
2. **NuGet Package Management**: Automated handling of package dependencies and versioning across the entire solution
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Build scripts that function consistently across Windows and Linux environments
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Support**: Integration with continuous integration systems for automated testing and deployment
5. **Configuration Management**: Tools for managing different build configurations (Debug, Release, Test) with appropriate settings

#### Overview
The architecture follows modern .NET build practices while accommodating OpenPetra's specific needs as an open-source non-profit management system. The build tools are designed to simplify the development workflow, ensure consistent builds across environments, and facilitate contributions from the open-source community. The system uses standard .NET build technologies where possible while providing custom extensions where needed for OpenPetra's unique requirements.

### csharp/ICT/Testing

This subproject implements automated test suites and quality assurance tools specifically designed for the C# codebase. The testing framework ensures reliability and stability across OpenPetra's core functionality, including contact management, accounting, and data processing modules.

The C# Testing subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated unit testing for business logic components
- Integration testing for database interactions
- Mock services for testing isolated components
- Regression testing for critical financial calculations
- Performance benchmarking for data processing operations

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Test Fixture Organization**: Tests are organized by functional domain (accounting, contacts, sponsorship) to maintain clear separation of concerns
2. **Mock Data Generation**: Utilities for creating realistic test data that simulates production scenarios
3. **Transaction Isolation**: Tests run in isolated transactions to prevent cross-test contamination
4. **Continuous Integration Support**: Test suites are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with appropriate reporting
5. **Configuration Switching**: Tests can run against different environment configurations to validate behavior across deployment scenarios

#### Overview
The architecture follows standard C# testing practices using NUnit as the primary testing framework. The test structure mirrors the application's architecture to ensure comprehensive coverage. Mock objects and dependency injection facilitate isolated component testing, while integration tests verify cross-component functionality. The framework includes specialized tools for testing financial calculations with precision requirements and data integrity validation across the system's various modules.

### csharp/ICT/Common

This library implements essential functionality that supports the core operations of OpenPetra's non-profit management system.

The library is organized into several key functional areas:

- **Error Handling & Logging**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy with serializable exceptions for remoting, standardized error codes, and a flexible logging system supporting multiple output destinations
- **Security & Authentication**: Password management with multiple hashing schemes (V1-V4) using Scrypt key stretching, security exceptions, and access control mechanisms
- **Configuration Management**: Server settings, application configuration, and command-line parameter processing
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages through GNU Gettext, number-to-words conversion, and culture-aware formatting
- **Utility Components**: 
  - Type definitions and data structures (TSelfExpandingArrayList, TVariant)
  - String manipulation and formatting utilities
  - Network and system information gathering
  - Version management and file handling
  - Thread management and identification

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Versioned Security Implementation**: Password hashing schemes are versioned (V1-V4) to allow secure migration paths as security requirements evolve
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Utilities detect operating environment and adapt behavior for different platforms
3. **Extensible Error System**: Centralized error code inventory with metadata for support staff
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Layered configuration system combining file-based settings with command-line overrides
5. **Remoting Support**: Serializable exceptions and data structures designed to work across .NET Remoting boundaries

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes security, internationalization, and cross-platform compatibility to support OpenPetra's global mission. The library provides a foundation for both client and server components, with clear separation between infrastructure concerns and application-specific logic. The modular design allows for extension and maintenance while maintaining backward compatibility for existing systems.
