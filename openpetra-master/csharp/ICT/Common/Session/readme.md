# C# Session Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# application that provides administrative management for non-profit organizations. The program handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while supporting data export capabilities. This sub-project implements thread-safe session state management with database persistence along with concurrent access control mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Database-backed session storage instead of standard ASP.NET session handling
- Thread-safe session management with mutex-based concurrency control
- Context-independent session handling that works with or without HttpContext
- Session variable management with typed storage and retrieval

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Thread-Static Session Management**: Uses thread-static variables to maintain session state per thread, allowing for clean separation of concerns across concurrent operations
2. **Database Persistence**: Sessions are stored in a database rather than in-memory, enabling session continuity across application restarts
3. **Mutex-Based Concurrency Control**: Implements mutex locking to prevent deadlocks during parallel session operations
4. **Context-Independent Architecture**: Session functionality works consistently regardless of whether it's accessed from web or non-web contexts

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes reliability through database persistence, scalability through thread-safe operations, and flexibility by decoupling from ASP.NET's standard session handling. The session management system provides a consistent interface for storing and retrieving session variables while handling session lifecycle events like initialization, refresh, and cleanup of expired sessions. This approach enables OpenPetra to maintain state across both web and non-web components of the application.

## Business Functions

### Session Management
- `Session.cs` : Session management class for OpenPetra that stores session data in a database rather than relying on HttpContext.

## Files
### Session.cs

TSession implements a static session management system for OpenPetra that stores session data in a database rather than relying on standard ASP.NET session handling. It provides thread-safe session management with database persistence, allowing sessions to work both with and without HttpContext. Key functionality includes initializing sessions per thread, storing and retrieving session variables, managing session lifetimes, and cleaning expired sessions. Important methods include InitThread(), SetVariable(), GetVariable(), HasVariable(), CloseSession(), and RefreshFromDatabase(). The class uses thread-static variables to maintain session state and implements mutex-based concurrency control to prevent deadlocks during parallel operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Uses ThreadStatic attribute to ensure session variables are isolated per thread, preventing cross-request contamination
- `Line 73`: Implements mutex-based concurrency control to prevent deadlocks during parallel session operations
- `Line 227`: Uses JSON serialization to store complex session data in a single database field
- `Line 244`: Includes backward compatibility check for database schema upgrades
- `Line 388`: Implements special handling for DEMO user sessions during session removal
