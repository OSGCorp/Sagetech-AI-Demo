# C# Remoting Client Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra C# Remoting Client is a critical integration component that enables client applications to communicate with the OpenPetra server via HTTP protocols. This subproject implements the client-side communication layer and serialization mechanisms that allow OpenPetra's distributed architecture to function effectively. The remoting client provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- HTTP-based remote procedure calls to server components
- Parameter serialization and response deserialization
- Security token management for authentication
- Flexible response handling for different return types

## Identified Design Elements

1. **HTTP Communication Layer**: Implements a robust connector for making remote calls to the OpenPetra server over standard HTTP protocols
2. **Parameter Conversion**: Transforms method parameters into name-value collections suitable for transmission over HTTP
3. **Security Management**: Handles authentication tokens and maintains secure communication sessions with the server
4. **Response Processing**: Processes XML/JSON responses and converts them to appropriate .NET types for client consumption
5. **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to capture and process server-side exceptions remotely

## Architecture Overview
The C# Remoting Client follows a clean separation of concerns, isolating the communication details from business logic. The HTTPConnector class serves as the primary interface for all server interactions, abstracting the complexities of remote procedure calls. This design allows client applications to interact with server components as if they were local objects, while the remoting layer handles all serialization, network communication, and error translation transparently.

## Business Functions

### HTTP Communication
- `HTTPConnector.cs` : Implements an HTTP connector for client-server communication in OpenPetra.

## Files
### HTTPConnector.cs

THttpConnector implements a class for connecting client applications to the OpenPetra server via HTTP. It handles serialization and deserialization of parameters and responses, manages security tokens, and provides methods for calling web connectors on the server. The class supports converting parameters to name-value collections, trimming XML responses, and handling different return types. Key methods include CallWebConnector, ConvertParameters, and TrimResult. Important variables include ServerURL and ServerAdminSecurityToken, which store connection information and authentication credentials.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 74`: Converts a SortedList of parameters to NameValueCollection and serializes each object
- `Line 88`: Trims XML response from server to extract the actual result data
- `Line 123`: Main method for calling server web connectors with support for different return types
