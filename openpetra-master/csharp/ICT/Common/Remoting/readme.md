# C# Remoting Subproject Of OpenPetra

The C# Remoting subproject provides the distributed communication infrastructure for OpenPetra, enabling the system to operate in a client-server architecture. This subproject implements a .NET Remoting framework that facilitates transparent method calls between client applications and the server, allowing OpenPetra to function as a distributed system while maintaining a cohesive user experience. The remoting layer abstracts network communication details from the application logic, providing these capabilities:

- Remote procedure calls across network boundaries
- Serialization and deserialization of complex data objects
- Session management and authentication
- Fault tolerance and error handling for network operations
- Asynchronous communication patterns

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Service Interface Contracts**: Defines the communication boundaries between client and server components through well-defined interfaces
2. **Proxy Generation**: Automatically creates client-side proxies that mirror server-side objects, making remote calls appear local
3. **Connection Management**: Handles network connections, reconnection logic, and connection pooling for optimal performance
4. **Data Marshalling**: Transforms complex .NET objects into serializable formats for transmission over the network
5. **Security Layer**: Implements authentication, authorization, and secure communication channels between clients and server

## Overview
The architecture follows a service-oriented approach with clear separation between interface definitions and implementations. The remoting infrastructure is designed to be transparent to application code, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than communication details. Performance optimizations include connection pooling, batched operations, and efficient serialization techniques to minimize network overhead in multi-user environments.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Common/Remoting/Server

This server-side implementation manages client connections, authentication, session state, and bidirectional communication between clients and the server. The remoting architecture follows a service-oriented approach with clearly defined interfaces for core functionality.

The subproject provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Client authentication and session management
- Server-to-client task distribution and polling mechanism
- Exception handling and comprehensive logging
- Database operations including backup, restoration, and upgrades
- State management across distributed components

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Session Management Architecture**: The DomainManager and ConnectedClient classes work together to maintain session state, track client connections, and manage session variables.
2. **Asynchronous Client Communication**: The ClientTasksManager implements a queue-based system for server-initiated communication to clients.
3. **Interface-Driven Design**: Core functionality is defined through interfaces (IUserManager, IImportExportManager, etc.) promoting loose coupling.
4. **Centralized Exception Handling**: The ExceptionHandling class provides comprehensive error logging and first-chance exception handling.

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes security through robust authentication mechanisms, scalability through efficient client connection tracking, and reliability through comprehensive error handling. The server manages client lifecycles from connection through authentication to disconnection, while providing administrative capabilities for monitoring and control. The polling mechanism enables efficient bidirectional communication while minimizing network overhead by avoiding empty data transfers.

### csharp/ICT/Common/Remoting/Shared

The program facilitates contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while enabling data export and international clearing house functionality. This sub-project implements the core remoting infrastructure that enables distributed communication between clients and servers within the OpenPetra architecture.  This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Binary and JSON serialization for cross-platform compatibility
- Interface definitions for remote procedure calls
- Server administration functionality through standardized interfaces
- Security validation to prevent injection attacks
- Caching mechanisms for performance optimization

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Standardized Remote Interface Architecture**: The IInterface base interface provides a foundation for all remoting interfaces, enabling consistent type casting across the distributed system
2. **Flexible Serialization System**: THttpBinarySerializer handles conversion between .NET objects and various formats (JSON, binary) with special handling for complex data structures
3. **Format-Aware Communication**: The system detects client types (JavaScript vs. fat clients) and adapts serialization formats accordingly
4. **Security-First Design**: Built-in validation prevents HTML injection attacks during serialization/deserialization processes
5. **Comprehensive Server Management**: The ServerAdminInterface provides robust capabilities for monitoring and controlling server operations remotely

#### Overview
The architecture establishes a communication foundation between client and server components, with clear separation between interface definitions and implementation. The remoting layer handles data transformation, security validation, and protocol management, while providing administrators with tools to monitor and maintain the server environment. This sub-project serves as the critical integration layer that enables OpenPetra's distributed architecture to function seamlessly across network boundaries.

### csharp/ICT/Common/Remoting/Client

This subproject implements the client-side communication layer and serialization mechanisms that allow OpenPetra's distributed architecture to function effectively. The remoting client provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- HTTP-based remote procedure calls to server components
- Parameter serialization and response deserialization
- Security token management for authentication
- Flexible response handling for different return types

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **HTTP Communication Layer**: Implements a robust connector for making remote calls to the OpenPetra server over standard HTTP protocols
2. **Parameter Conversion**: Transforms method parameters into name-value collections suitable for transmission over HTTP
3. **Security Management**: Handles authentication tokens and maintains secure communication sessions with the server
4. **Response Processing**: Processes XML/JSON responses and converts them to appropriate .NET types for client consumption
5. **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to capture and process server-side exceptions remotely

#### Architecture Overview
The C# Remoting Client follows a clean separation of concerns, isolating the communication details from business logic. The HTTPConnector class serves as the primary interface for all server interactions, abstracting the complexities of remote procedure calls. This design allows client applications to interact with server components as if they were local objects, while the remoting layer handles all serialization, network communication, and error translation transparently.
