# C# Executables Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra C# Executables subproject provides the core application executables and entry points for the OpenPetra system. This subproject implements the main application processes and command-line interfaces that power the non-profit management platform. The executables serve as the runtime environment for OpenPetra's business logic, handling everything from server operations to specialized data processing tasks.

This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Server process management and lifecycle control
- Command-line tools for administration and maintenance
- Client application entry points
- Batch processing capabilities for scheduled operations
- Data import/export utilities for integration with external systems

## Identified Design Elements

1. Service Architecture: Implements a service-oriented design that separates the application into distinct functional components that can be deployed and managed independently
2. Configuration Management: Provides robust configuration handling with environment-specific settings and overrides
3. Multi-tenant Support: Enables hosting multiple organizations on a single server instance with proper data isolation
4. Internationalization Framework: Incorporates localization capabilities throughout the executables to support global deployment
5. Security Infrastructure: Implements authentication, authorization, and audit logging across all executable components

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular design pattern allowing components to be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The executables leverage .NET Core for cross-platform compatibility while maintaining backward compatibility with existing systems. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through consistent error handling, logging, and dependency management. This subproject serves as the operational foundation for OpenPetra's non-profit management capabilities, providing the runtime environment for accounting, contact management, and administrative functions.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Testing/exe/I18N_GNU_Gettext

This sub-project implements internationalization (i18n) capabilities using GNU Gettext, enabling OpenPetra to be accessible across multiple languages and cultures. The C# I18N GNU Gettext module provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- String translation management through GettextResourceManager
- Localization of user interface elements
- Culture-specific formatting of dates, numbers, and currencies
- Runtime language switching without application restart

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Resource Management**: GettextResourceManager handles the loading and access of translated strings from catalog files
2. **Catalog Integration**: Seamless integration with standard GNU Gettext .po/.mo catalog files
3. **String Extraction**: Support for extracting translatable strings from C# source code
4. **Translation Context**: Ability to provide context for translators to ensure accurate translations
5. **Pluralization Support**: Handles complex plural forms across different languages

#### Overview

The architecture follows the established GNU Gettext patterns while adapting them to the C# environment. The implementation is lightweight but powerful, allowing developers to mark strings for translation using simple method calls. The test program demonstrates the basic usage pattern where translatable strings are wrapped in GetString() method calls. This approach maintains code readability while enabling comprehensive internationalization. The subproject serves as a foundation for OpenPetra's multilingual capabilities, crucial for its global deployment in non-profit organizations worldwide.

### csharp/ICT/Testing/exe/I18N

This critical infrastructure allows OpenPetra to serve international non-profit organizations by providing localized interfaces in their preferred languages. The subproject handles translation resource management, locale switching, and string externalization throughout the application.

Key capabilities provided to OpenPetra include:

- Dynamic locale switching without application restart
- Resource file management for multiple languages
- Translation string retrieval via standardized API
- Automated handling of pluralization rules
- Culture-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **GNU Gettext Integration**: Leverages the established Gettext toolchain for managing translation workflows and PO/MO files
2. **Catalog Management**: Handles initialization, loading, and switching between different locale catalogs
3. **Resource File Handling**: Automatically manages resource file availability, with fallback mechanisms
4. **Translation Testing Framework**: Provides utilities to verify translation completeness and accuracy
5. **Toolchain Support**: Includes integration with xgettext, msgfmt, and msgcat for translation file processing

#### Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices by separating translatable content from code, supporting multiple locales, and providing developer-friendly APIs for string retrieval. The test framework ensures translations remain functional as the application evolves. This subproject is fundamental to OpenPetra's mission of serving international organizations by enabling them to use the system in their preferred language, while maintaining consistent functionality across all localized versions.
