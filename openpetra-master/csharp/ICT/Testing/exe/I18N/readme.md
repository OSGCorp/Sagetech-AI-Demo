# C# Internationalization Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra C# Internationalization subproject implements a robust localization framework using GNU Gettext to enable multilingual support across the application. This critical infrastructure allows OpenPetra to serve international non-profit organizations by providing localized interfaces in their preferred languages. The subproject handles translation resource management, locale switching, and string externalization throughout the application.

Key capabilities provided to OpenPetra include:

- Dynamic locale switching without application restart
- Resource file management for multiple languages
- Translation string retrieval via standardized API
- Automated handling of pluralization rules
- Culture-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies

## Identified Design Elements

1. **GNU Gettext Integration**: Leverages the established Gettext toolchain for managing translation workflows and PO/MO files
2. **Catalog Management**: Handles initialization, loading, and switching between different locale catalogs
3. **Resource File Handling**: Automatically manages resource file availability, with fallback mechanisms
4. **Translation Testing Framework**: Provides utilities to verify translation completeness and accuracy
5. **Toolchain Support**: Includes integration with xgettext, msgfmt, and msgcat for translation file processing

## Overview
The architecture follows internationalization best practices by separating translatable content from code, supporting multiple locales, and providing developer-friendly APIs for string retrieval. The test framework ensures translations remain functional as the application evolves. This subproject is fundamental to OpenPetra's mission of serving international organizations by enabling them to use the system in their preferred language, while maintaining consistent functionality across all localized versions.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Testing/exe/I18N/Sample-de-DE

## Business Functions

### Internationalization Testing
- `Program.cs` : A test program for internationalization (I18N) functionality in OpenPetra using GNU Gettext.

## Files
### Program.cs

Program.cs implements a test application for internationalization (I18N) functionality in OpenPetra using GNU Gettext. It demonstrates how to initialize the Catalog with different locales (de-DE and en-GB) and retrieve translated strings. The program ensures the German translation resource file exists, copying it from a sample location if needed. It outputs translated strings to the console and handles exceptions by displaying error messages. The file includes detailed comments about using xgettext, msgfmt, and msgcat tools for working with translation files.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 33`: Contains detailed documentation about using GNU Gettext tools for extracting and compiling translation files
- `Line 47`: Demonstrates proper resource file handling by checking existence and copying from sample location if needed
- `Line 54`: Shows initialization of Catalog with specific culture codes for internationalization
