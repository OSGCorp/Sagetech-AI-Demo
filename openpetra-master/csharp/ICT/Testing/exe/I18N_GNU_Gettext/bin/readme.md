# C# I18N Binaries Subproject Of OpenPetra

The C# I18N Binaries subproject provides internationalization (I18N) support for the OpenPetra application, enabling multilingual capabilities across the entire platform. This subproject implements resource compilation, localization string management, and culture-specific formatting, allowing OpenPetra to serve diverse global non-profit organizations in their native languages.

## Key Capabilities

- Dynamic language switching at runtime without application restart
- Automated resource file compilation into binary assemblies for performance optimization
- Culture-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies
- Translation management workflow support
- Fallback mechanisms for missing translations

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Resource Binary Compilation**: Converts .resx files into compiled satellite assemblies for efficient runtime access
2. **Culture Resolution Chain**: Implements hierarchical culture fallback to ensure graceful degradation when translations are incomplete
3. **String Interpolation System**: Handles parameterized messages with proper grammatical rules for different languages
4. **Localization Manager**: Central service that coordinates resource loading and caching for optimal performance
5. **Translation Extraction Tools**: Utilities to identify translatable strings and generate resource files for translators

## Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a provider pattern where localization services are injected into application components. Resource files are organized hierarchically by module, with a central registry maintaining the relationship between resource identifiers and their localized values. The binary compilation process optimizes runtime performance by pre-processing resource files into efficient binary formats, significantly reducing the overhead of string lookups in production environments.
