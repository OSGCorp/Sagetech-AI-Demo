# C# I18N GNU Gettext Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra application is a C# program that helps non-profit organizations manage administration and reduce operational costs. This sub-project implements internationalization (i18n) capabilities using GNU Gettext, enabling OpenPetra to be accessible across multiple languages and cultures. The C# I18N GNU Gettext module provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- String translation management through GettextResourceManager
- Localization of user interface elements
- Culture-specific formatting of dates, numbers, and currencies
- Runtime language switching without application restart

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Resource Management**: GettextResourceManager handles the loading and access of translated strings from catalog files
2. **Catalog Integration**: Seamless integration with standard GNU Gettext .po/.mo catalog files
3. **String Extraction**: Support for extracting translatable strings from C# source code
4. **Translation Context**: Ability to provide context for translators to ensure accurate translations
5. **Pluralization Support**: Handles complex plural forms across different languages

## Overview

The architecture follows the established GNU Gettext patterns while adapting them to the C# environment. The implementation is lightweight but powerful, allowing developers to mark strings for translation using simple method calls. The test program demonstrates the basic usage pattern where translatable strings are wrapped in GetString() method calls. This approach maintains code readability while enabling comprehensive internationalization. The subproject serves as a foundation for OpenPetra's multilingual capabilities, crucial for its global deployment in non-profit organizations worldwide.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Testing/exe/I18N_GNU_Gettext/bin

This subproject implements resource compilation, localization string management, and culture-specific formatting, allowing OpenPetra to serve diverse global non-profit organizations in their native languages.

#### Key Capabilities

- Dynamic language switching at runtime without application restart
- Automated resource file compilation into binary assemblies for performance optimization
- Culture-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies
- Translation management workflow support
- Fallback mechanisms for missing translations

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Resource Binary Compilation**: Converts .resx files into compiled satellite assemblies for efficient runtime access
2. **Culture Resolution Chain**: Implements hierarchical culture fallback to ensure graceful degradation when translations are incomplete
3. **String Interpolation System**: Handles parameterized messages with proper grammatical rules for different languages
4. **Localization Manager**: Central service that coordinates resource loading and caching for optimal performance
5. **Translation Extraction Tools**: Utilities to identify translatable strings and generate resource files for translators

#### Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a provider pattern where localization services are injected into application components. Resource files are organized hierarchically by module, with a central registry maintaining the relationship between resource identifiers and their localized values. The binary compilation process optimizes runtime performance by pre-processing resource files into efficient binary formats, significantly reducing the overhead of string lookups in production environments.

## Business Functions

### Internationalization Testing
- `Program.cs` : A simple test program demonstrating GNU Gettext internationalization in C#

## Files
### Program.cs

This test program demonstrates basic internationalization using GNU Gettext in C#. It creates a simple Example class with a GettextResourceManager instance that handles string translations. The Main method outputs a translatable 'Hello world!' message using the GetString method from the catalog. This demonstrates how to implement basic i18n functionality in OpenPetra using the GNU.Gettext namespace.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 30`: Creates a GettextResourceManager with 'my_class' as catalog identifier for translation lookup
- `Line 36`: Demonstrates the pattern for making strings translatable by wrapping them in GetString() method calls
