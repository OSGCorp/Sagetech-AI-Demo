# C# Sponsorship Module Of Petra

The Petra application is a C# program that helps non-profit organizations manage administration tasks including contact management, accounting, and sponsorship. This sub-project implements the child sponsorship management functionality, providing a structured approach to tracking sponsored children and their relationships with sponsors. This module provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Child record management with unique identifiers
- Reminder system for sponsorship-related actions
- Comment tracking for sponsored children
- Sponsorship relationship management between donors and children

## Identified Design Elements

1. Database Integration: The module connects to a database backend to store and retrieve sponsorship data
2. Random Data Generation: Support for creating test data with randomized child information
3. Verification Systems: Methods to confirm successful creation and modification of sponsorship records
4. Relationship Management: Structured approach to linking sponsors with children
5. Web Connectivity: Uses TSponsorshipWebConnector to facilitate web-based interactions with the sponsorship system

## Overview

The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation between data access, business logic, and testing components. The module is designed for testability, with comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability of core sponsorship functions. The data model supports complex relationships between sponsors and children while maintaining data integrity. Integration with the broader Petra application allows this module to leverage shared components while providing specialized functionality for sponsorship management.

## Business Functions

### Testing
- `test.cs` : Test suite for OpenPetra's sponsorship management functionality

## Files
### test.cs

TSponsorshipTesting implements a test suite for OpenPetra's child sponsorship management functionality. It tests creating new sponsored children, adding reminders, comments, and sponsorships. The test class connects to a test database, creates a child with random name data, verifies the creation was successful, and attempts to add associated data. Key methods include RunTest(), SelectAllChildren(), CreateNewChild(), SelectCreatedChild(), CreateNewReminders(), CreateNewComments(), and CreateNewSponsorship(). The class uses TSponsorshipWebConnector to interact with the sponsorship system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 70`: Test orchestration method that runs all tests in sequence rather than letting NUnit control execution order
- `Line 85`: Uses RandomString utility method to generate unique test data for child names
- `Line 107`: Test creates a child record and verifies success before proceeding with dependent tests
