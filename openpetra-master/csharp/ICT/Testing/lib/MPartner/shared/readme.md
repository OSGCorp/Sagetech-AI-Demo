# C# Partner Shared Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and contact management across international boundaries. This sub-project implements partner data structures and test data generation along with relationship modeling between different partner types. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Partner entity modeling (family, person, organization, church, bank, venue, unit)
- Test data generation for partner-related functionalities
- Supporting data structures for locations, banking details, and financial transactions
- Relationship management between different partner types

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Comprehensive Partner Type System**: The module implements various partner types with appropriate records and relationships, enabling flexible entity management
2. **Financial Integration**: Partners connect to financial systems through banking details, gift transactions, and accounts payable documents
3. **Test Data Generation**: Structured approach to creating test scenarios with proper keys and relationships
4. **Cross-Module Integration**: Partners connect to other system components like personnel management and location services

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes a robust data model for partner entities with clear relationships between different types. The test data generation capabilities ensure proper validation of partner-related functionalities across the system. The design supports both simple partner records and complex relationship scenarios, making it a foundational component for many of OpenPetra's core features including contact management, financial transactions, and organizational relationships.

## Business Functions

### Test Data Generation

## Files
### CreateTestPartnerData.cs

TCreateTestPartnerData provides methods to generate test data for the Partner module in OpenPetra. It creates various partner types (family, person, organization, church, bank, venue, unit) with appropriate records and relationships. The class also generates supporting data like locations, banking details, gift transactions, recurring gifts, accounts payable documents, and personnel management data. Each method handles the creation of necessary database records with proper keys and relationships, making it easy to set up test scenarios for different partner-related functionalities.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 57`: Partner key generation uses site-specific keys and ensures uniqueness through submission and verification
- `Line 168`: Banking details creation demonstrates the relationship between multiple partner-related banking tables
- `Line 283`: Gift creation shows the hierarchical relationship between batch, gift, and gift detail records
- `Line 320`: Recurring gift creation follows similar pattern to regular gifts but with different table structure
- `Line 393`: Personnel management data creation shows cross-module integration between partner and personnel systems
