# C# Partner Module Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra Partner Module is a C# implementation that provides comprehensive contact management functionality within the OpenPetra platform. The module serves as the foundation for managing all entity relationships in the system, handling both individual and organizational contacts. This sub-project implements a robust data model with extensive validation logic along with flexible search and retrieval capabilities. The Partner Module provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Complete contact management for individuals, organizations, and families
- Address and communication data handling with international format support
- Relationship mapping between different partner entities
- Subscription and publication management
- Customizable partner attribute tracking and classification

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Domain-Driven Design Structure**: Clear separation between domain entities, repositories, and service layers for maintainable code organization
2. **Flexible Data Access Layer**: Repository pattern implementation allowing for efficient querying and data manipulation
3. **Comprehensive Validation Framework**: Robust validation rules ensure data integrity across all partner-related operations
4. **Event-Based Architecture**: Changes to partner data trigger appropriate events for dependent modules
5. **Internationalization Support**: Built-in handling for different address formats, name conventions, and localization requirements

## Overview
The Partner Module architecture emphasizes scalability and extensibility, allowing for easy addition of new partner types and attributes. The codebase follows SOLID principles with clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation concerns. The module integrates with other OpenPetra components through well-defined interfaces, providing a foundation for features like accounting, sponsorship, and reporting functionality.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Testing/lib/MPartner/SampleData

The program handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while supporting data export and international financial operations. This sub-project implements partner data import testing functionality along with sample datasets for validating the system's data handling capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Sample data files for partner import validation
- Test cases for various date format handling (DMY and MDY)
- Error handling validation with deliberately invalid data
- Edge case testing with unknown columns and fields
- Sample hierarchical partner structures with different classifications

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Multiple Data Format Support: The subproject provides test data in both CSV and YAML formats to validate different import pathways
2. International Date Format Handling: Specific test files target date format variations (DMY/MDY) to ensure proper parsing across regions
3. Validation Testing: Invalid data samples are included to test the system's error handling and validation mechanisms
4. Complex Relationship Modeling: The YAML structure demonstrates partner grouping hierarchies and shared attributes like addresses

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes comprehensive test coverage for the partner import functionality, providing data samples that test both normal operations and edge cases. The test data includes various partner types (individuals, families, organizations) with different classifications and special designations. The subproject ensures OpenPetra's partner management system can handle diverse data formats, international date conventions, and properly validate incoming data while rejecting or flagging problematic records.

### csharp/ICT/Testing/lib/MPartner/server

This sub-project handles the processing of partner-related operations including partner creation, modification, merging, and reporting. It provides a robust API layer that supports both HTML and JSON responses, enabling both web interface and programmatic access to partner data. This sub-project provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Partner data management (creation, editing, deletion)
- Partner relationship handling and merging operations
- Banking details management for partners
- Address validation and selection based on validity dates and preferences
- Reporting functionality with multiple output formats
- CSV import/export capabilities with validation
- GDPR-compliant consent management for contact information

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Multi-format Response Handling**: Controllers support both JSON and HTML output formats, allowing the system to serve both API and web interface consumers
2. **Modular Report Generation**: The reporting system uses parameter-driven templates to generate consistent reports across different partner views (by city, special type, subscription)
3. **Partner Type Validation**: The system enforces business rules regarding partner relationships, merges, and dependencies
4. **Address Selection Logic**: Sophisticated algorithms determine the best address for partners based on validity dates and mailing preferences
5. **Data Consent Management**: Implementation of GDPR-compliant consent tracking for contact information display and usage
6. **Parameterized Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite using XML parameter files and expected result templates

#### Overview
The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation between partner data management, reporting, and utility functions. The partner management components handle the core CRUD operations while enforcing business rules about relationships and dependencies. The reporting system uses a parameter-driven approach with flexible output formatting. Address management includes sophisticated selection logic to determine the most appropriate address based on multiple criteria. The entire system is thoroughly tested with a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering various partner operations and edge cases.

### csharp/ICT/Testing/lib/MPartner/shared

The program handles financial transactions and contact management across international boundaries. This sub-project implements partner data structures and test data generation along with relationship modeling between different partner types. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Partner entity modeling (family, person, organization, church, bank, venue, unit)
- Test data generation for partner-related functionalities
- Supporting data structures for locations, banking details, and financial transactions
- Relationship management between different partner types

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Comprehensive Partner Type System**: The module implements various partner types with appropriate records and relationships, enabling flexible entity management
2. **Financial Integration**: Partners connect to financial systems through banking details, gift transactions, and accounts payable documents
3. **Test Data Generation**: Structured approach to creating test scenarios with proper keys and relationships
4. **Cross-Module Integration**: Partners connect to other system components like personnel management and location services

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes a robust data model for partner entities with clear relationships between different types. The test data generation capabilities ensure proper validation of partner-related functionalities across the system. The design supports both simple partner records and complex relationship scenarios, making it a foundational component for many of OpenPetra's core features including contact management, financial transactions, and organizational relationships.
