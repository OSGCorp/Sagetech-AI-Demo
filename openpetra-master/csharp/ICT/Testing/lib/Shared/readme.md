# C# Testing Shared Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial operations and contact management while reducing operational overhead. This sub-project implements unit testing infrastructure for the Ict.Petra.Shared library components, focusing on validation of core shared functionality that underpins the entire application.  This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Automated validation of shared component functionality
- Verification of critical data conversion operations
- Testing of date and time handling mechanisms
- Regression prevention for core utility methods

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Test Fixture Architecture**: Implements standardized test fixtures for validating shared library components
2. **Date/Time Conversion Testing**: Focuses on validating bidirectional conversions between DateTime objects and integer representations
3. **Logging Integration**: Incorporates logging initialization in test setup to ensure proper diagnostic capabilities
4. **Isolated Test Cases**: Maintains separate test cases for different conversion scenarios to isolate potential issues

## Overview
The architecture follows standard unit testing practices with clear test case isolation and proper setup/teardown procedures. The test suite specifically targets the Conversions class functionality, with particular attention to date and time handling which is critical for many OpenPetra operations including financial transactions and scheduling. The tests validate that conversions are lossless and maintain data integrity across the application's shared components.

## Business Functions

### Testing Components
- `test.cs` : Testing module for OpenPetra's shared library functionality, focusing on date/time conversions.

## Files
### test.cs

TTestShared implements a test fixture for the Ict.Petra.Shared library. It contains unit tests for validating functionality in the shared components of OpenPetra. The primary test case focuses on date and time conversions, specifically testing the DateTimeToInt32Time and Int32TimeToDateTime methods from the Conversions class. The class initializes logging in the SetUp method and verifies that time values are correctly converted to integers and back to DateTime objects with two different test cases.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Sets up logging to a specific file path for test output
- `Line 49`: Tests bidirectional conversion between DateTime objects and Int32 representations of time
