# C# Verification Testing Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program implements contact management, accounting, and sponsorship tracking while reducing operational costs. This sub-project implements comprehensive verification and validation functionality along with robust error handling and reporting mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Input validation for various data types (numerical, string, date)
- Structured error collection and severity management
- Verification result formatting for both user and system consumption
- Comprehensive testing framework for validation logic

## Identified Design Elements

1. Hierarchical Verification Results: The TVerificationResultCollection class manages collections of validation results with different severity levels (critical, error, warning)
2. Flexible Search Capabilities: The verification system provides multiple methods to find and filter validation results by criteria, context, or severity
3. Polymorphic Validation: Supports validation across different data types with consistent interfaces and error reporting
4. Formatted Output Generation: Can build structured verification result strings for display or logging purposes

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes thorough input validation with clear error reporting, enabling both user-facing feedback and system-level error handling. The verification framework supports multiple data types with specialized validation logic for each, while maintaining a consistent interface. The collection management capabilities allow for sophisticated error tracking, with the ability to distinguish between different severity levels and provide contextual information about validation failures. This verification layer serves as a critical foundation for data integrity throughout the OpenPetra application.

## Business Functions

### Verification Testing
- `testVerificationResultCollection.cs` : Unit tests for TVerificationResultCollection class in OpenPetra, validating error handling and result management functionality.
- `test.cs` : Test suite for numerical, string, and date validation functions in the Ict.Common.Verification library.

## Files
### test.cs

This test file implements comprehensive unit tests for the verification functionality in OpenPetra's common library. It tests various validation methods for numerical values (integers, decimals, doubles), string values, and date values. The tests verify proper validation of positive/negative numbers, date ranges, string comparisons, and email formats. Each test method systematically checks both valid and invalid inputs against expected verification results. The file includes helper methods for comparing verification results and formatting error messages. Key test methods include TestNumericalChecks(), TestStringChecks(), and TestDateChecks(), which thoroughly validate the behavior of their respective verification classes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: The test fixture initializes error code inventory and logging for verification tests
- `Line 56`: Helper method evaluates if verification results match expected outcomes
- `Line 89`: Comprehensive test suite for numerical validation with positive/negative/zero checks
- `Line 688`: String validation tests include email format verification with multiple address support
- `Line 1022`: Date range validation tests handle complex scenarios including past/future/unrealistic dates
### testVerificationResultCollection.cs

This test file validates the TVerificationResultCollection class from Ict.Common.Verification.dll, which manages collections of verification results with different severity levels. The tests cover counting errors, checking properties like HasCriticalErrors, adding/removing elements, finding results by various criteria, and building formatted result strings. Key functionality tested includes collection manipulation (Add, Insert, Remove), searching (FindBy, Contains), and output formatting (BuildVerificationResultString). Important methods tested are TestCountErrorsAndHasProperties, TestAddingElements, TestContains, TestFindBy, TestRemove, and TestBuildVerificationResultString.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 71`: Tests the HasOnlyNonCriticalErrors property which distinguishes between having no errors and having only non-critical errors
- `Line 149`: Tests the Contains method with multiple overloads for different object types including DataColumn and DataTable
- `Line 227`: FindAllBy method demonstrates collection's ability to retrieve multiple results matching specific criteria
- `Line 341`: BuildVerificationResultString formats verification results with appropriate severity indicators and formatting
