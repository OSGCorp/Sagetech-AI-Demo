# C# Data Testing Subproject Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# program that provides administrative management tools for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and manages organizational data across multiple domains. This sub-project implements database integration testing and performance benchmarking along with data integrity validation mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Database transaction testing with timestamp validation
- Performance benchmarking for data loading operations
- Data integrity verification during record updates
- Integration testing for the Ict.Common.Data library

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Database Connection Management**: The test framework establishes and tears down database connections using TPetraServerConnector methods to ensure proper test isolation
2. **Transaction Integrity Testing**: Validates that record updates maintain proper modification timestamps and data integrity
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Implements comparative analysis of different data loading approaches to optimize application performance
4. **Integration Testing Framework**: Provides a structured approach to testing database operations within the broader OpenPetra system

## Overview
The architecture focuses on validating the reliability and performance of database operations critical to OpenPetra's functionality. The test suite specifically targets the Ict.Common.Data library, ensuring that database transactions maintain data integrity while providing insights into performance optimization opportunities. The testing framework is designed to be comprehensive yet maintainable, with clear separation between connection management, transaction testing, and performance benchmarking components.

## Business Functions

### Data Testing
- `test.cs` : Testing module for Ict.Common.Data library focusing on database operations with gift batches and performance testing.

## Files
### test.cs

TTestCommonData implements NUnit tests for the Ict.Common.Data library, focusing on database operations within OpenPetra. The file contains test fixtures for database transactions, specifically testing record updates with modification timestamps and investigating performance of loading data tables. Key tests include UpdateRecord() which tests updating gift batch records while maintaining data integrity, and SpeedTestLoadIntoTypedTable() which benchmarks different approaches to loading data. The class connects to a test database server before tests and disconnects afterward using TPetraServerConnector methods.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 73`: Tests modification timestamp tracking when updating database records
- `Line 115`: Performance benchmark comparing different methods of loading data tables
- `Line 122`: Uses custom SQL with joins rather than standard data access methods
- `Line 56`: Uses transaction-based delegate pattern for database operations
