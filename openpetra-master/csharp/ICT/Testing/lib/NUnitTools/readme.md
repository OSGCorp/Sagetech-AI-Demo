# C# NUnit Tools Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra is a C# application that provides administrative management for non-profit organizations. The program handles financial transactions and contact management across multiple currencies and regions. This sub-project implements specialized testing infrastructure for OpenPetra's automated test suite along with database management utilities for test environments. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Test database initialization and management
- Event verification and assertion framework
- Test data loading and validation
- Server administration during test execution
- Automated ledger creation for financial testing

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Database Test Environment Management**: Provides utilities for initializing test databases, loading test data, and resetting database state between tests
2. **Event Testing Framework**: Implements specialized classes for capturing and verifying event raising during test execution
3. **Server Control Interface**: Offers methods to start, stop and control the OpenPetra server during integration tests
4. **Data Verification Tools**: Includes utilities for validating test results against expected values in various formats
5. **Test Data Manipulation**: Provides methods for working with CSV files and SQL data specifically formatted for testing scenarios

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes test isolation through database reset capabilities, provides comprehensive event verification, and enables automated test setup. The tools are designed for maintainability across the OpenPetra test suite, with clear separation between database management and event verification concerns. The framework supports both unit and integration testing needs, with robust utilities for validating complex financial operations across the application.

## Business Functions

### Testing Tools
- `CommonNUnitFunctions.cs` : Provides utility functions for NUnit testing in OpenPetra, including database management and verification tools.
- `EventAssertHelper.cs` : Provides NUnit testing utilities for event assertion in OpenPetra, enabling verification of event raising behavior.

## Files
### CommonNUnitFunctions.cs

CommonNUnitFunctions implements a class with utility methods for OpenPetra testing. It provides functionality for database management, including initializing paths, loading test data, resetting databases, and creating new ledgers. Key features include executing server admin commands, starting the OpenPetra server, running nant build commands, and verification result validation. The class also contains methods for working with CSV files, handling SQL data, and managing test environments. Important methods include InitRootPath(), LoadTestDataBase(), CreateNewLedger(), and EnsureNullOrEmptyVerificationResult(). The file also implements a DateConverter class for parsing and formatting dates in test strings.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: Dynamically determines the root path of the OpenPetra project directory structure for test execution
- `Line 109`: Custom implementation for loading PostgreSQL-formatted test data into MySQL databases
- `Line 245`: Cross-platform server administration console execution handling both Windows and Linux environments
- `Line 352`: Verification result validation helpers that integrate with NUnit's assertion framework
- `Line 408`: Custom date parsing using regex to extract dates from formatted strings for test validation
### EventAssertHelper.cs

This file implements two classes for NUnit testing of events: TNUnitEventAsserter (static class) and TNUnitEventHandlerCheck<TEventArgs>. Together they provide a framework for verifying whether events are raised during test execution. TNUnitEventAsserter offers static methods like Assert(), GotRaised<>() and DidNotGetRaised<>() that work with the event capturer class. TNUnitEventHandlerCheck<TEventArgs> tracks event raising status and captures sender and event arguments, with methods like ResetCheck() and Handler() to manage the event testing lifecycle.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 50`: Generic method implementation allows testing events with any EventArgs-derived type
- `Line 65`: Fluent API design pattern for readable test assertions with lambda expressions
- `Line 77`: Complementary assertion method creates symmetrical API for positive/negative testing
