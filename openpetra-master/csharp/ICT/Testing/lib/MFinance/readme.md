# C# Finance Module Of Petra

The Petra Finance Module is a C# implementation that provides comprehensive accounting and financial management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The module handles core financial operations through a layered architecture that separates business logic, data access, and presentation concerns. This sub-project implements double-entry bookkeeping principles and multi-currency transaction processing, delivering these key capabilities to the Petra application:

- Complete General Ledger functionality with chart of accounts management
- Multi-currency transaction processing with automated exchange rate handling
- Financial reporting with configurable report templates
- Budget management and variance analysis
- International Clearing House operations for minimizing currency exchange costs
- Batch processing for efficient transaction management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Domain-Driven Financial Model**: Implements accounting principles as domain objects with clear separation from persistence mechanisms
2. **Multi-Currency Engine**: Core transaction processing maintains base and foreign currency values with configurable exchange rate sources
3. **Reporting Framework**: Extensible reporting system with customizable templates and export formats
4. **Data Validation Layer**: Comprehensive validation rules ensure financial data integrity before persistence
5. **Batch Processing System**: Transactions are grouped into batches for review, approval, and posting workflows

## Overview
The architecture follows accounting best practices with strict data validation and audit trails. The module integrates with other Petra components through well-defined interfaces while maintaining financial data integrity. The reporting system provides both standard financial statements and customizable reports for organizational needs. The International Clearing House functionality is particularly notable for organizations operating across multiple countries, reducing currency exchange costs through internal settlement processes.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ICT/Testing/lib/MFinance/SampleData

The program handles accounting, contact management, and data exchange while supporting international operations. This sub-project implements sample financial data templates and test datasets along with import/export configurations for the finance module. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Financial document generation with HTML templates for receipts and statements
- Sample data for testing budget imports and gift processing
- Standardized CSV formats for financial data exchange
- Configuration files for data import mapping and transformation

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Templated Financial Documents: HTML templates with placeholders enable dynamic generation of tax-compliant financial documents like donation receipts
2. Structured Data Import: YAML configuration files define mappings between external data formats and internal financial structures
3. Multi-currency Support: Sample data demonstrates international financial operations with different currencies (e.g., KES)
4. Budget Modeling: CSV files provide examples of various budget types (Same, Split, Adhoc, Inflation-based) for testing budget functionality

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes standardized data formats for financial information exchange, templated document generation for regulatory compliance, and comprehensive test datasets covering various financial scenarios. The templates support internationalization with multi-language capabilities, particularly for tax documentation. The sample data demonstrates the system's ability to handle complex financial operations including budget planning, gift processing, and general ledger transactions across different accounting periods and currencies.

### csharp/ICT/Testing/lib/MFinance/server

The program handles accounting, contact management, and sponsorship tracking while supporting international operations. This sub-project implements the core financial server components along with API interfaces for client applications. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- General Ledger (GL) management with period-end processing
- Accounts Payable (AP) operations with multi-currency support
- Gift processing with receipt generation and recurring gift management
- Bank statement import and reconciliation
- Financial reporting with customizable parameters
  - Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, Income/Expense Statements
  - Account Detail reports with filtering capabilities
- International Clearing House (ICH) operations for cross-border transactions

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Multi-Currency Support: Comprehensive handling of foreign currencies with exchange rate management, revaluation processes, and proper accounting entries
2. Modular Financial Components: Clear separation between GL, AP, Gift, and ICH modules with well-defined interfaces
3. Flexible Import/Export: Support for multiple banking formats (CSV, CAMT.052, CAMT.053, MT940) and financial data interchange
4. Robust Testing Framework: Extensive unit tests with fixtures for validating financial calculations and data integrity
5. Templated Reporting: HTML and PDF report generation with customizable parameters and formatting

#### Overview
The architecture follows standard accounting principles with a strong focus on data integrity and auditability. The General Ledger serves as the foundation with specialized modules for different financial functions. The system supports complex workflows including month-end and year-end processes, gift batch management, and international fund transfers. The codebase emphasizes validation at multiple levels to ensure financial data remains accurate and balanced. The reporting system provides both standard financial statements and specialized reports for non-profit operations, with support for cost center accounting across international operations.
