## C# Third-Party Libraries of OpenPetra

The C# Third-Party Libraries subproject manages external dependencies that OpenPetra relies on to deliver its non-profit organization management capabilities. This subproject doesn't contain application code itself, but rather organizes and maintains the collection of third-party components that provide essential functionality to the OpenPetra ecosystem.

The subproject serves as a dependency management layer that:

- Centralizes external library references for consistent versioning across the application
- Provides namespace mapping to corresponding DLL paths for build system resolution
- Includes critical libraries for:
  - PDF generation and manipulation (PDFsharp)
  - Internationalization support (GNU.Gettext)
  - Data compression and archiving (SharpZipLib)
  - Database connectivity (Npgsql, MySqlConnector)
  - JSON serialization/deserialization (Newtonsoft.Json)
  - Testing infrastructure (NUnit)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Dependency Isolation**: Third-party code is clearly separated from OpenPetra's own codebase, with distinct licensing documentation
2. **Namespace Resolution**: The namespace.map file provides a centralized configuration for resolving assembly references
3. **Multi-Database Support**: Includes connectors for different database systems, enabling deployment flexibility
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Libraries selected support OpenPetra's cross-platform requirements

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean dependency management, proper attribution of third-party code, and flexible deployment options. By centralizing these dependencies, the project maintains consistency across builds and simplifies the process of updating external libraries when needed.

## Sub-Projects

### csharp/ThirdParty/GNU

This sub-project implements internationalization capabilities through GNU gettext integration, providing a robust framework for multi-language support across the entire application. The C# GNU Libraries provide these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Resource management for internationalization using GNU gettext principles
- Translation lookups across multiple assemblies for different cultures
- Support for both standard translations and plural forms
- Culture-specific plural form evaluation

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Custom ResourceManager Implementation**: GettextResourceManager extends the standard .NET ResourceManager to provide GNU gettext-style internationalization
2. **Multi-Assembly Translation Support**: The system can look up translations across different assemblies, enabling modular internationalization
3. **Caching Mechanism**: Translations are cached for performance optimization, reducing lookup overhead
4. **Plural Form Handling**: Sophisticated support for plural forms with culture-specific rules for proper linguistic representation
5. **Particular Context Support**: Allows for context-specific translations where the same term might have different meanings in different contexts

#### Overview
The architecture follows GNU gettext internationalization principles while integrating seamlessly with .NET's resource management framework. The implementation consists of a custom ResourceManager and ResourceSet that handle both singular and plural translations with appropriate cultural sensitivity. This approach enables OpenPetra developers to create applications that can be easily localized to different languages and regions, making the software accessible to a global audience while maintaining a consistent codebase.

### csharp/ThirdParty/ICSharpCode

The program handles financial transactions and provides comprehensive data management capabilities. This sub-project incorporates essential third-party libraries from ICSharpCode to extend OpenPetra's functionality in compression, decompression, and code analysis. These libraries provide the following capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- File compression and archiving through SharpZipLib
- ZIP, GZIP, and TAR format support for data exchange and storage
- Code analysis and refactoring capabilities via NRefactory
- Cross-platform compatibility for both Windows and Linux environments

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Libraries specifically compiled for .NET 4.0 to ensure compatibility across Windows and Linux build environments
2. **Version Control**: Carefully managed library versions (SharpZipLib 0.86.0.518 and NRefactory 4.1.0.8000) to maintain stability
3. **Integration Architecture**: Libraries integrated as external dependencies rather than modified source code
4. **Warning Suppression**: Custom compilation to avoid warnings on Linux build servers

#### Overview
The architecture leverages established open-source components from the SharpDevelop project to provide robust file compression and code analysis capabilities. These libraries are maintained as external dependencies with specific version requirements to ensure stability across different deployment environments. The integration approach prioritizes cross-platform compatibility while minimizing build warnings, particularly in Linux environments where OpenPetra may be deployed as part of its non-profit organization support mission.

### csharp/ThirdParty/PasswordUtilities

The program handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while supporting international operations. This sub-project implements secure password management functionality with configurable policies and cryptographic operations. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Secure password generation with configurable character sets
- Password validation against customizable policies
- Password hashing with SHA1-160 and SHA2-256 algorithms
- Password strengthening and verification mechanisms
- Salt generation and management for enhanced security

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Configurable Password Policies**: The system implements flexible password requirements including minimum/maximum length and character distribution rules
2. **Customizable Character Sets**: Supports various character categories (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, punctuation, brackets) that can be individually enabled or disabled
3. **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: Implements both SHA1-160 and SHA2-256 with configurable work factors
4. **Policy-Based Validation**: Provides methods to validate passwords against established policies with detailed failure reporting
5. **OpenPetra-Specific Customizations**: Contains specialized constants and enhanced validation logic specifically tailored for OpenPetra's requirements

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes security best practices through salt generation, multiple hashing algorithms, and configurable work factors. The password policy system provides flexibility while enforcing organizational security requirements. The MIT-licensed code has been customized for OpenPetra's specific needs while maintaining GPL v3 compatibility, making it both secure and legally compliant for open-source use.

## Business Functions

### Documentation
- `LICENSE` : Third-party license notice for OpenPetra project components

### Configuration
- `namespace.map` : Namespace mapping configuration file for OpenPetra that defines library dependencies and their file paths.

## Files
### LICENSE

This file serves as a license notice for the ThirdParty directory in the OpenPetra project. It clarifies that the projects and files in this directory are not part of the OpenPetra project itself. The notice directs users to check the readme or license files within each subdirectory to find information about the respective licenses and copyright holders of these third-party components.
### namespace.map

This configuration file maps namespace references to their corresponding DLL file paths in the OpenPetra project. It defines paths for third-party libraries like GNU.Gettext, PDFsharp, SharpZipLib, database connectors (Npgsql, MySqlConnector), and utility libraries such as Newtonsoft.Json and NUnit. The file also maps standard .NET framework libraries to their locations in the csharpStdLibs directory. This mapping helps the build system locate the correct assemblies when resolving references during compilation, ensuring proper dependency management across the OpenPetra application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-16`: Maps third-party libraries using variables like ${dir.3rdParty} and ${dir.nuget} to handle different package sources
- `Line 17-42`: Maps standard .NET framework libraries using ${csharpStdLibs} variable for platform independence
- `Line 43`: Special comment indicating System* must be processed last to prevent namespace conflicts
