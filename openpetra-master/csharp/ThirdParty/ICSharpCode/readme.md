# Third Party C# ICSharpCode Libraries Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra application is a C# program that helps non-profit organizations manage administration and reduce operational costs. The program handles financial transactions and provides comprehensive data management capabilities. This sub-project incorporates essential third-party libraries from ICSharpCode to extend OpenPetra's functionality in compression, decompression, and code analysis. These libraries provide the following capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- File compression and archiving through SharpZipLib
- ZIP, GZIP, and TAR format support for data exchange and storage
- Code analysis and refactoring capabilities via NRefactory
- Cross-platform compatibility for both Windows and Linux environments

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Libraries specifically compiled for .NET 4.0 to ensure compatibility across Windows and Linux build environments
2. **Version Control**: Carefully managed library versions (SharpZipLib 0.86.0.518 and NRefactory 4.1.0.8000) to maintain stability
3. **Integration Architecture**: Libraries integrated as external dependencies rather than modified source code
4. **Warning Suppression**: Custom compilation to avoid warnings on Linux build servers

## Overview
The architecture leverages established open-source components from the SharpDevelop project to provide robust file compression and code analysis capabilities. These libraries are maintained as external dependencies with specific version requirements to ensure stability across different deployment environments. The integration approach prioritizes cross-platform compatibility while minimizing build warnings, particularly in Linux environments where OpenPetra may be deployed as part of its non-profit organization support mission.

## Business Functions

## Files
### readme.txt

This readme file documents the third-party libraries from ICSharpCode used in the OpenPetra project. It specifies that ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll is taken from the SharpDevelop project and compiled for .Net 4.0 to avoid warnings on the Linux build server, with the current version being 0.86.0.518. It also mentions that ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll is from the SharpDevelop project, version 4.1.0.8000 from SharpDevelop 4.1.
