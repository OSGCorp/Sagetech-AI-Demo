# Third Party C# Password Utilities Of OpenPetra

The OpenPetra system is a C# application that provides administrative management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The program handles contact management, accounting, and sponsorship while supporting international operations. This sub-project implements secure password management functionality with configurable policies and cryptographic operations. This provides these capabilities to the OpenPetra program:

- Secure password generation with configurable character sets
- Password validation against customizable policies
- Password hashing with SHA1-160 and SHA2-256 algorithms
- Password strengthening and verification mechanisms
- Salt generation and management for enhanced security

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Configurable Password Policies**: The system implements flexible password requirements including minimum/maximum length and character distribution rules
2. **Customizable Character Sets**: Supports various character categories (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, punctuation, brackets) that can be individually enabled or disabled
3. **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: Implements both SHA1-160 and SHA2-256 with configurable work factors
4. **Policy-Based Validation**: Provides methods to validate passwords against established policies with detailed failure reporting
5. **OpenPetra-Specific Customizations**: Contains specialized constants and enhanced validation logic specifically tailored for OpenPetra's requirements

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes security best practices through salt generation, multiple hashing algorithms, and configurable work factors. The password policy system provides flexibility while enforcing organizational security requirements. The MIT-licensed code has been customized for OpenPetra's specific needs while maintaining GPL v3 compatibility, making it both secure and legally compliant for open-source use.

## Business Functions

### Password Management
- `PasswordPolicy.cs` : Defines password policy rules for generation and validation with configurable character sets and length requirements.
- `readme.txt` : Documentation for a C# password utilities library used in OpenPetra for secure password management.

## Files
### PasswordPolicy.cs

PasswordPolicy implements a class for controlling password generation and validation with configurable rules. It manages allowed character sets (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, punctuation, brackets, and other ASCII characters), minimum and maximum password lengths, and character distribution requirements. The class provides methods to add, remove, and configure character sets, validate passwords against policy rules, and determine if passwords satisfy specific character distribution requirements. Key functionality includes policy setup, character set management, and password validation against configurable rules. Important properties include LengthMinimum, LengthMaximum, AllowedCharacterSets, and AllowedSymbols.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 374`: Custom password validation enforces specific character distribution: 7-8 alphabetic characters and 2-3 numeric characters.
- `Line 80`: Default character sets are defined with specific categories that can be customized or replaced.
- `Line 427`: Uses LINQ to efficiently remove duplicate symbols from the allowed character set.
### readme.txt

This readme file documents a C# library for password management in OpenPetra. It handles secure password generation, salting, hashing (SHA1-160 and SHA2-256), password strengthening, verification, and policy enforcement. The library implements password policies for length and character requirements, and hashing policies for algorithm selection, storage format, work factor, and salt bytes. The documentation notes that PasswordPolicy.cs was modified specifically for OpenPetra's needs, with customized constants and additional code in the PasswordSatisfiesPolicy method. The library is MIT licensed and compatible with GPL v3.
