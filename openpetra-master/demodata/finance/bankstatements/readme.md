# Demo Bank Statements Subproject Of Petra

The Demo Bank Statements subproject is a configuration component that defines how OpenPetra imports and processes bank statement data from external financial institutions. This subproject focuses on data mapping and transformation, enabling the system to correctly interpret CSV-formatted bank statements for integration into OpenPetra's accounting and financial management systems.

The subproject implements CSV column mapping configuration along with field transformation rules that standardize external banking data into OpenPetra's internal data model. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Structured mapping of external bank statement formats to internal data structures
- Configuration-based field transformation without code changes
- Support for international banking standards (IBAN/BIC)
- Flexible handling of various CSV formats from different financial institutions

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Declarative Data Mapping**: The configuration defines explicit mappings between external CSV columns and internal data fields, allowing for adaptation to different bank statement formats
2. **Field Selection Logic**: The configuration specifies which fields are relevant for processing and which should be ignored (marked as "unused")
3. **Financial Data Normalization**: Ensures transaction dates, amounts, and currency information are correctly interpreted regardless of source format
4. **Banking Identifier Support**: Properly handles international banking identifiers like IBAN and BIC codes for cross-border transaction processing

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration over code, allowing OpenPetra to adapt to different bank statement formats without requiring programming changes. The mapping system provides a standardized approach to importing financial data while maintaining the integrity of transaction information. This design supports OpenPetra's international focus, particularly for organizations dealing with multiple currencies and financial institutions across different countries.

## Business Functions

### Banking Configuration
- `settings.txt` : Configuration file for bank statement import in OpenPetra's finance module.

## Files
### settings.txt

This settings file defines the column structure for importing bank statements in a CSV format. It specifies which columns contain relevant financial data including transaction dates, descriptions, account information (IBAN/BIC), amounts, and currency. The file maps CSV columns to OpenPetra's internal data structure, indicating which fields should be used and which can be ignored (marked as 'unused'). This configuration enables the system to correctly parse and process bank statement data during import operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Defines a CSV header structure with semicolon separators for bank statement imports
- `Line 3`: Maps specific columns to OpenPetra's internal data structure, marking irrelevant fields as 'unused'
