# Demo Data Subproject Of Petra

The Demo Data subproject provides essential testing and development infrastructure for OpenPetra by generating realistic sample data that simulates a working non-profit organization environment. This subproject implements comprehensive data generation routines along with configurable templates that model real-world organizational structures, financial transactions, and contact relationships. This provides these capabilities to the Petra program:

- Automated generation of consistent test datasets across all modules
- Configurable data volume scaling from small demos to enterprise-level stress testing
- Realistic financial transaction patterns with proper accounting relationships
- Comprehensive contact and organization hierarchies with appropriate relationships

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based Generation**: Uses predefined templates to ensure generated data follows realistic patterns and maintains referential integrity across the system
2. **Module-Specific Generators**: Specialized generators for each functional area (accounting, contacts, sponsorship) that understand the business rules of that domain
3. **Deterministic Randomization**: Employs seeded random generation to create varied but reproducible datasets for consistent testing
4. **Time-Series Simulation**: Generates chronological data with appropriate temporal patterns for financial transactions, correspondence, and organizational changes

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach where each functional area has dedicated generation components that understand the business rules and data relationships specific to that domain. The generators maintain referential integrity across the system while providing configurable parameters to adjust data volume and complexity. This enables developers to quickly create realistic test environments that exercise the full range of OpenPetra's capabilities, from basic CRUD operations to complex multi-currency financial reconciliation and reporting scenarios.

## Sub-Projects

### demodata/databases

This component is critical to the system's functionality as it establishes the baseline database state required for the application to operate properly. The subproject centers around template database definitions that enable rapid deployment and consistent testing environments.

The primary component is the `empty.yml` file, which serves as the canonical database template containing the complete hierarchical structure of OpenPetra's data model. This template defines:

- System management tables (MSysMan)
- Common reference data (MCommon)
- Partner/contact management structures (MPartnerPartner)
- Financial module schemas (MFinance)
- Personnel management data models (MPersonnel)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **YAML-Based Database Definition**: Uses a human-readable format for defining database structures that can be easily maintained and version-controlled
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Structures data in logical modules with clear parent-child relationships
3. **Default Reference Data**: Provides essential lookup values like country codes, currencies, and partner types
4. **Bootstrap Credentials**: Includes default DEMO user account for initial system access
5. **Module Configuration**: Defines system modules and their relationships

#### Overview
The architecture of the Demo Databases subproject emphasizes maintainability through clear structural organization and separation of concerns between different functional domains. The YAML-based approach allows for both human editing and programmatic manipulation of the database templates. This component serves as the foundation for both development environments and production deployments, ensuring consistency across all OpenPetra installations.

### demodata/formletters

Implemented as HTML templates with dynamic data binding capabilities, this subsystem enables the generation of professional financial documents and donor communications. The templates use a placeholder system (prefixed with #) that gets replaced with actual data during document generation, allowing for personalized yet consistent outputs across different document types.

#### Key Technical Features

- Standardized Document Generation: Creates consistent financial and donor communications
- Dynamic Data Binding: Uses placeholder variables for runtime data insertion
- Multi-format Support: Templates designed for both print and digital distribution
- Localization Support: Region-specific templates (e.g., en-GB variants) for international compliance
- Conditional Content Sections: Templates can include or exclude sections based on document type

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Template Inheritance System**: Base templates can be extended for specific document types while maintaining consistent styling and structure
2. **Responsive Layout Design**: Documents adapt to different output formats while preserving readability
3. **Financial Data Formatting**: Specialized handling for currency values, dates, and financial identifiers
4. **Multi-page Support**: Page break controls for proper document pagination in both digital and print formats
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Templates include required legal disclaimers and tax information formatting

#### Architecture Overview

The templates are organized by functional domain (Finance Management, Reports, Gift Receipts) and follow HTML standards with embedded styling. The architecture emphasizes separation between presentation and data, allowing the business logic to focus on data preparation while the templates handle formatting and layout. This design supports easy maintenance and extension of document types without requiring changes to the underlying application code.

### demodata/partners

This component supports OpenPetra's partner management functionality, which is central to the system's contact management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The subproject primarily consists of CSV-based sample data files that model the expected structure and format for partner imports.

#### Key Technical Features

- Standardized CSV import formats for partner data integration
- Sample data structures for multiple partner entity types (FAMILY, ORGANISATION, UNIT)
- Demonstration of complex relationship modeling between partner entities
- Reference implementations for consent tracking and GDPR compliance fields
- Banking information integration templates (IBAN formatting)

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Multi-row Entity Representation**: Partner records span multiple rows with hierarchical relationships between primary entities and their associated details
2. **Comprehensive Field Typing**: Demonstrates proper formatting for various data types including text, dates, numeric identifiers, and specialized formats
3. **Consent Management Structure**: Includes fields for tracking communication consent by channel and purpose
4. **International Support**: Contains country-specific formatting examples for addresses and banking information
5. **Partner Classification System**: Implements OpenPetra's partner categorization framework with status indicators and special type designations

#### Technical Architecture

The sample files serve as both documentation and test fixtures, providing developers with reference implementations for the partner data model. These files align with OpenPetra's data import subsystems and demonstrate the expected structure for integrating external partner data sources into the application's contact management functionality.
