# Demo Databases Subproject Of OpenPetra

The Demo Databases subproject provides the foundational data structures and reference datasets necessary for initializing and testing OpenPetra installations. This component is critical to the system's functionality as it establishes the baseline database state required for the application to operate properly. The subproject centers around template database definitions that enable rapid deployment and consistent testing environments.

The primary component is the `empty.yml` file, which serves as the canonical database template containing the complete hierarchical structure of OpenPetra's data model. This template defines:

- System management tables (MSysMan)
- Common reference data (MCommon)
- Partner/contact management structures (MPartnerPartner)
- Financial module schemas (MFinance)
- Personnel management data models (MPersonnel)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **YAML-Based Database Definition**: Uses a human-readable format for defining database structures that can be easily maintained and version-controlled
2. **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Structures data in logical modules with clear parent-child relationships
3. **Default Reference Data**: Provides essential lookup values like country codes, currencies, and partner types
4. **Bootstrap Credentials**: Includes default DEMO user account for initial system access
5. **Module Configuration**: Defines system modules and their relationships

## Overview
The architecture of the Demo Databases subproject emphasizes maintainability through clear structural organization and separation of concerns between different functional domains. The YAML-based approach allows for both human editing and programmatic manipulation of the database templates. This component serves as the foundation for both development environments and production deployments, ensuring consistency across all OpenPetra installations.

## Business Functions

### Database Templates
- `empty.yml` : Empty database template for OpenPetra with predefined system tables and default values.

## Files
### empty.yml

This file serves as the empty database template for OpenPetra, containing the initial structure and default values needed to bootstrap a new OpenPetra installation. It defines all the system tables organized in a hierarchical structure under the RootNodeInternal node, with major sections including MSysMan (system management), MCommon (shared reference data), MPartnerPartner (partner/contact management), MFinance modules, and MPersonnel modules. Key data includes a default DEMO user account, module definitions, country codes, currencies, partner types, and accounting reference data. The file uses YAML format with a structure of tables containing rows of field-value pairs that will be loaded during system initialization.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Contains default DEMO user with hashed password and system administrator account
- `Line 9`: Defines core system modules that control access permissions in OpenPetra
- `Line 30`: User permissions section defines what tables and modules the default DEMO user can access
- `Line 43`: Contains comprehensive list of world languages with their codes and display properties
- `Line 99`: Extensive country database with international telephone codes, postal types and time zones
