# Demo Partners Subproject Of Petra

Demo Partners is a subproject within OpenPetra that provides sample partner data structures and import formats for testing and demonstration purposes. This component supports OpenPetra's partner management functionality, which is central to the system's contact management capabilities for non-profit organizations. The subproject primarily consists of CSV-based sample data files that model the expected structure and format for partner imports.

## Key Technical Features

- Standardized CSV import formats for partner data integration
- Sample data structures for multiple partner entity types (FAMILY, ORGANISATION, UNIT)
- Demonstration of complex relationship modeling between partner entities
- Reference implementations for consent tracking and GDPR compliance fields
- Banking information integration templates (IBAN formatting)

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Multi-row Entity Representation**: Partner records span multiple rows with hierarchical relationships between primary entities and their associated details
2. **Comprehensive Field Typing**: Demonstrates proper formatting for various data types including text, dates, numeric identifiers, and specialized formats
3. **Consent Management Structure**: Includes fields for tracking communication consent by channel and purpose
4. **International Support**: Contains country-specific formatting examples for addresses and banking information
5. **Partner Classification System**: Implements OpenPetra's partner categorization framework with status indicators and special type designations

## Technical Architecture

The sample files serve as both documentation and test fixtures, providing developers with reference implementations for the partner data model. These files align with OpenPetra's data import subsystems and demonstrate the expected structure for integrating external partner data sources into the application's contact management functionality.

## Business Functions

### Partner Import Data
- `samplefilepartnerimport2.csv` : CSV file containing sample partner import data for OpenPetra with various partner types and their details.
- `samplePartnerImport.csv` : Sample CSV file for partner data import in OpenPetra with organization and personal information fields.

## Files
### samplePartnerImport.csv

This CSV file provides sample data for importing partners into OpenPetra. It contains a header row defining fields for personal and organizational information, including names, contact details, addresses, and consent records. The file demonstrates the expected format with four sample entries: three individuals and one organization. Fields include personal information (name, title, gender), contact details (email, phone), address information, categorization fields, consent tracking data with channels and purposes, and banking information (IBAN).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Header row defines all available import fields including organization, personal details, contact information, categories, consent tracking, and banking data
- `Line 2-5`: Sample data demonstrates both individual and organizational partner records with varying levels of completeness
### samplefilepartnerimport2.csv

This CSV file provides sample data for importing partners into OpenPetra. It contains structured records for different partner types including FAMILY, ORGANISATION, and UNIT entities with their associated details. The file includes fields for partner classification, country, status, keys, personal information, contact details, and special type designations. Each partner record spans multiple rows, with the first row containing the entity type and subsequent rows containing detailed information like addresses, emails, and phone numbers. The file demonstrates the expected format for bulk partner imports with various partner categories and relationship structures.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1`: Header row defines the complete data structure with fields for classification, contact details, and organizational relationships
- `Line 3`: Partner records use a multi-row format where the first row defines the entity type and subsequent rows contain detailed information
- `Line 4`: Special partner types are defined as comma-separated values within quotes (e.g., "VOLUNTEER, SUPPORTER")
- `Line 20`: UNIT records demonstrate hierarchical relationships with ParentUnitKey references
