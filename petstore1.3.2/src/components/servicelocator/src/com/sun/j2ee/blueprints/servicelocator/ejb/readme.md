# Service Locator EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java Enterprise application that demonstrates J2EE design patterns and best practices through an e-commerce platform. The program implements enterprise-level transaction processing and provides a reference architecture for scalable web applications. This sub-project implements the Service Locator pattern for EJB components along with centralized JNDI resource management. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized JNDI lookup services for all J2EE resources
- Abstraction layer for accessing both local and remote EJB components
- Unified error handling through ServiceLocatorException
- Resource acquisition for various J2EE components (EJBs, JMS, DataSources)

## Identified Design Elements

1. Singleton-like Access Pattern: Provides a static instance variable for application-wide access to JNDI resources
2. Comprehensive Resource Lookup: Supports multiple resource types including EJB homes, JMS resources, DataSources, and environment entries
3. Error Encapsulation: Wraps low-level JNDI exceptions in a service-specific exception type
4. Resource Type Differentiation: Distinct methods for local vs. remote EJB home interfaces

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by isolating JNDI lookup logic from business components. This reduces coupling between application components and the JNDI API, improving maintainability and testability. The Service Locator pattern implemented here centralizes configuration management and provides a consistent interface for resource acquisition throughout the application, simplifying the client code that needs to access enterprise resources.

## Business Functions

### Service Locator
- `ServiceLocator.java` : Service Locator implementation for accessing J2EE resources like EJB homes, JMS destinations, and data sources.

## Files
### ServiceLocator.java

ServiceLocator implements the Service Locator pattern to provide centralized JNDI lookup services for J2EE resources. It offers methods to retrieve EJB homes (both local and remote), JMS resources (queues, topics, and their connection factories), DataSources, and environment entries (URLs, strings, booleans). The class encapsulates JNDI context creation and error handling, wrapping exceptions in ServiceLocatorException. Key methods include getLocalHome(), getRemoteHome(), getQueue(), getTopic(), getDataSource(), and various environment entry getters. The class maintains an InitialContext instance for performing lookups and provides a singleton-like static instance variable.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Implementation of the Service Locator design pattern for J2EE resource access
- `Line 82`: Uses PortableRemoteObject.narrow() for type-safe EJB remote interface casting
- `Line 49`: Class maintains a static instance variable 'me' but doesn't implement full singleton pattern
