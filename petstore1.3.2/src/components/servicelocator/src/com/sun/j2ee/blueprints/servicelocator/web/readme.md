## Service Locator Web Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices for e-commerce systems. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and showcases J2EE design patterns in action. This sub-project implements the Service Locator pattern for web-tier resource access along with JNDI integration capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized resource lookup mechanism for J2EE components
- Performance optimization through resource caching
- Abstraction of complex JNDI lookup operations
- Exception handling and management for resource access

## Identified Design Elements

1. Singleton Pattern Implementation: The ServiceLocator class uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance manages resource lookups across the application
2. Resource Caching: Improves performance by storing previously looked-up resources in a synchronized HashMap to avoid repeated JNDI lookups
3. Comprehensive J2EE Resource Support: Provides access to EJB homes (both local and remote), JMS destinations (queues and topics), DataSources, and environment entries
4. Exception Abstraction: Wraps low-level JNDI exceptions in a ServiceLocatorException to simplify error handling for client code

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by isolating resource lookup logic from business components. The ServiceLocator acts as an integration layer between the web tier and backend J2EE resources, providing a clean API that shields developers from JNDI complexities. This pattern reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and enhances performance through its caching mechanism. The implementation is thread-safe and handles various resource types needed by the Pet Store application, making it a critical infrastructure component for the entire system.

## Business Functions

### Service Locator
- `ServiceLocator.java` : Implements the Service Locator pattern for J2EE resources, providing cached access to EJB homes, JMS resources, and other services.

## Files
### ServiceLocator.java

ServiceLocator implements the Service Locator design pattern for web tier applications in the Java Pet Store. It provides centralized access to J2EE resources like EJB homes, JMS destinations, DataSources, and environment entries. The class uses both singleton and caching strategies to improve performance by storing looked-up resources in a synchronized HashMap. Key functionality includes methods for retrieving local and remote EJB homes, JMS connection factories, queues, topics, DataSources, and environment entries. The class handles all JNDI lookups and wraps exceptions in ServiceLocatorException. Important methods include getInstance(), getLocalHome(), getRemoteHome(), getQueue(), getTopic(), getDataSource(), and various getters for environment entries.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: Implements singleton pattern with static initialization block to ensure single instance
- `Line 71`: Uses Collections.synchronizedMap to make the cache thread-safe
- `Line 91`: Caching strategy improves performance by storing previously looked-up resources
- `Line 116`: Uses PortableRemoteObject.narrow for type-safe EJB remote home lookups
