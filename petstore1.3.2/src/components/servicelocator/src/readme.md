# Service Locator Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Service Locator Source Root is a Java implementation that provides a centralized mechanism for accessing distributed J2EE resources within the Java Pet Store application. The project implements the Service Locator design pattern to abstract and encapsulate all JNDI lookups and resource acquisition, while improving performance through resource caching. This subproject provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized access to J2EE resources (EJB homes, JMS destinations, DataSources)
- Performance optimization through caching of looked-up resources
- Exception handling and abstraction through custom ServiceLocatorException
- Support for both web tier and EJB tier resource access

## Identified Design Elements

1. Singleton Pattern Implementation: Both web and EJB ServiceLocator classes use singleton patterns to ensure a single point of access for resource lookups
2. Resource Caching: Uses synchronized HashMap to store previously looked-up resources, reducing JNDI lookup overhead
3. Exception Wrapping: Custom ServiceLocatorException encapsulates lower-level exceptions, providing cleaner error handling
4. Dual-Tier Support: Separate implementations for web and EJB tiers with consistent interfaces

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by isolating resource lookup logic from business components. The ServiceLocator classes handle all JNDI context creation, lookups, and exception management, allowing client code to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns. The caching strategy significantly improves performance by avoiding repeated lookups of the same resources. The build process is managed through Ant, with clear targets for compilation, JAR creation, and deployment. This pattern implementation serves as a foundational component that other Pet Store modules depend on for accessing enterprise resources.

## Sub-Projects

### src/components/servicelocator/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator

This sub-project implements the Service Locator J2EE design pattern, abstracting the complexity of JNDI lookups and service discovery from the rest of the application. By centralizing service location logic, it reduces code duplication and simplifies maintenance of service dependencies throughout the application.

This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized service lookup and caching mechanism
- Abstraction of JNDI context initialization and lookup operations
- Exception handling specific to service location failures
- Reduced coupling between service clients and service implementation details

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Exception Handling Framework: Custom ServiceLocatorException class provides specialized error handling for service lookup failures
2. Wrapping Pattern Implementation: Encapsulates lower-level exceptions while maintaining the original error context
3. Root Cause Analysis: Built-in functionality to traverse exception chains to identify fundamental issues
4. Cross-Cutting Error Management: Consistent exception handling approach across the service location layer

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by isolating service discovery logic from business components. The exception handling framework provides meaningful context for troubleshooting while preserving the original error information. This implementation follows J2EE best practices by reducing direct dependencies on JNDI APIs throughout the application and providing a consistent interface for service access.

## Business Functions

### Resource Access
- `com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/web/ServiceLocator.java` : Implements the Service Locator pattern for J2EE resources, providing cached access to EJB homes, JMS resources, and other services.
- `com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/ServiceLocatorException.java` : Custom exception class for the service locator pattern that can wrap lower-level exceptions.
- `com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/ejb/ServiceLocator.java` : Service Locator implementation for accessing J2EE resources like EJB homes, JMS destinations, and data sources.

### Build Configuration
- `build.xml` : Ant build script for the ServiceLocator component in Java Pet Store.

## Files
### build.xml

This build.xml file defines the Ant build process for the ServiceLocator component in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes build properties, directory structures, and compilation targets. Key functionality includes compiling Java source files, creating JAR files, and cleaning build artifacts. The script defines targets for initialization, compilation, JAR creation, and cleanup. Important properties include servicelocator.home, servicelocator.build, servicelocator.src, j2ee.classpath, and servicelocator.client.jar. Main targets are init, compile, clientjar, clean, core, and all.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 69`: Creates a classpath that combines the component's compiled classes with J2EE libraries
- `Line 80`: Compiles only files in the com/** package structure, limiting scope to component code
- `Line 97`: Defines 'core' as a composite target that runs both compile and clientjar targets
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/ServiceLocatorException.java

ServiceLocatorException implements a custom exception class for the service locator pattern in the Java Pet Store application. It extends the standard Java Exception class and provides functionality to wrap lower-level exceptions. The class offers three constructors for different initialization scenarios: with a message and wrapped exception, with only a message, or with only a wrapped exception. Key methods include getException() to retrieve the wrapped exception and getRootCause() to recursively find the root cause exception. The class also overrides toString() to properly display the exception chain.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 89`: The getRootCause() method uses recursion to traverse the exception chain to find the original cause of the error.
- `Line 98`: The toString() method delegates to the wrapped exception when possible, maintaining the exception chain's integrity in string representation.
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/ejb/ServiceLocator.java

ServiceLocator implements the Service Locator pattern to provide centralized JNDI lookup services for J2EE resources. It offers methods to retrieve EJB homes (both local and remote), JMS resources (queues, topics, and their connection factories), DataSources, and environment entries (URLs, strings, booleans). The class encapsulates JNDI context creation and error handling, wrapping exceptions in ServiceLocatorException. Key methods include getLocalHome(), getRemoteHome(), getQueue(), getTopic(), getDataSource(), and various environment entry getters. The class maintains an InitialContext instance for performing lookups and provides a singleton-like static instance variable.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Implementation of the Service Locator design pattern for J2EE resource access
- `Line 82`: Uses PortableRemoteObject.narrow() for type-safe EJB remote interface casting
- `Line 49`: Class maintains a static instance variable 'me' but doesn't implement full singleton pattern
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/servicelocator/web/ServiceLocator.java

ServiceLocator implements the Service Locator design pattern for web tier applications in the Java Pet Store. It provides centralized access to J2EE resources like EJB homes, JMS destinations, DataSources, and environment entries. The class uses both singleton and caching strategies to improve performance by storing looked-up resources in a synchronized HashMap. Key functionality includes methods for retrieving local and remote EJB homes, JMS connection factories, queues, topics, DataSources, and environment entries. The class handles all JNDI lookups and wraps exceptions in ServiceLocatorException. Important methods include getInstance(), getLocalHome(), getRemoteHome(), getQueue(), getTopic(), getDataSource(), and various getters for environment entries.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: Implements singleton pattern with static initialization block to ensure single instance
- `Line 71`: Uses Collections.synchronizedMap to make the cache thread-safe
- `Line 91`: Caching strategy improves performance by storing previously looked-up resources
- `Line 116`: Uses PortableRemoteObject.narrow for type-safe EJB remote home lookups
