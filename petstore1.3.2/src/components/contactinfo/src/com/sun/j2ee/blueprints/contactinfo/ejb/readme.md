# Contact Info EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture patterns and best practices. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases J2EE component integration. This sub-project implements customer contact information management through Enterprise JavaBeans along with JNDI-based service location and XML serialization capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Persistent storage of customer contact details (name, phone, email)
- Structured address management through related EJB components
- Local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access
- XML serialization for data exchange and persistence

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) and Container-Managed Relationships (CMR) to handle data persistence without explicit SQL code
2. Value Object Pattern: Implements ContactInfo as a serializable data transfer object to encapsulate contact data between layers
3. Service Locator Pattern: Utilizes JNDI lookups through centralized constants to decouple service dependencies
4. XML Integration: Provides DOM-based serialization/deserialization for contact data interchange

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between interface and implementation. The ContactInfoEJB entity bean manages persistence while exposing functionality through the ContactInfoLocal interface. Address relationships are maintained through CMR, allowing for structured address management. The design emphasizes reusability and maintainability through value objects that can move across application tiers, while JNDI constants centralize integration points for easier configuration management.

## Business Functions

### Contact Information Management
- `ContactInfoLocal.java` : Local EJB interface defining contact information operations for the Java Pet Store application.
- `ContactInfoLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for ContactInfo EJB defining creation and finder methods.
- `ContactInfo.java` : Data model class representing contact information with XML serialization capabilities.
- `ContactInfoEJB.java` : Entity bean for managing contact information in the Java Pet Store application

### Integration Utilities
- `JNDINames.java` : Defines JNDI name constants for the ContactInfo component in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### ContactInfo.java

ContactInfo implements a data model class for storing personal contact information including name, address, email, and phone number. It provides constructors, getters, and setters for all fields, and implements XML serialization/deserialization through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods. The class works with the Address class for structured address information and uses XMLDocumentUtils for DOM manipulation. Constants define XML element names and DTD identifiers used in the serialization process.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 131`: XML deserialization method uses a structured approach to parse DOM elements in a specific order
- `Line 114`: toDOM method demonstrates how to build a structured XML document from object properties
### ContactInfoEJB.java

ContactInfoEJB implements an entity bean that manages customer contact information including name, telephone, email, and address details. It provides abstract getter/setter methods for CMP fields, maintains a relationship with AddressLocal through CMR, and offers multiple ejbCreate methods for different initialization scenarios. The class includes a getData() method that returns a ContactInfo value object containing all contact information. Standard EJB lifecycle methods are implemented to handle entity bean operations. Key components include abstract CMP field methods, CMR field for address relationship, and ServiceLocator usage for address creation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 76`: Uses ServiceLocator pattern to obtain EJB references rather than direct JNDI lookups
- `Line 115`: Implements a data transfer object pattern with getData() to transfer entity data to client tier
- `Line 53`: Demonstrates Container-Managed Relationships (CMR) with AddressLocal entity
### ContactInfoLocal.java

ContactInfoLocal defines a local EJB interface for managing customer contact information in the Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject and provides getter and setter methods for contact details including family name, given name, address, telephone number, and email address. The interface also includes a getData() method to retrieve the complete ContactInfo object. It interacts with the AddressLocal interface to manage address information, forming part of the customer data management system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: The interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component accessible only within the same JVM
### ContactInfoLocalHome.java

ContactInfoLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the ContactInfo Enterprise JavaBean in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding ContactInfo entities. The interface includes three create methods: one with no parameters, another accepting individual contact information fields (name, telephone, email) and an address object, and a third accepting a ContactInfo value object. It also defines a standard findByPrimaryKey method to retrieve existing ContactInfo entities by their primary key.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: The interface uses AddressLocal as a parameter type, showing composition relationship between contact info and address components
- `Line 49`: Provides multiple creation methods with different parameter sets, demonstrating flexible entity instantiation patterns
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames implements a utility class that serves as a central repository for JNDI name constants used in the ContactInfo component. The class prevents instantiation through a private constructor and defines a single public static final constant ADDR_EJB that stores the JNDI name for the Address EJB. This constant is used to look up the Address EJB in the application's JNDI context. The class documentation notes that any changes to these constants should be reflected in the deployment descriptors to maintain consistency.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Private constructor prevents instantiation of this utility class, enforcing its use as a static constants container
- `Line 49`: The JNDI name uses the java:comp/env namespace, following J2EE best practices for portable component references
