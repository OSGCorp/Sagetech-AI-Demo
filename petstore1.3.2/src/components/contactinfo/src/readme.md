# Customer Contact Info Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Customer Contact Info Source Root is a Java component that manages customer contact information within the Java Pet Store e-commerce application. The component implements a robust data management system for customer details through Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology, specifically using Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) entity beans. This sub-project implements customer data storage and retrieval along with address management capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Structured storage of customer contact information (name, email, phone)
- Address management with comprehensive field support
- XML serialization/deserialization for data interchange
- EJB-based persistence with transaction management

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Uses two primary CMP entity beans (ContactInfoEJB and AddressEJB) with a one-to-one relationship and cascade delete functionality
2. Value Object Pattern: Implements ContactInfo and Address classes as data transfer objects between presentation and persistence layers
3. XML Data Representation: Provides XML serialization/deserialization with defined DTD schemas for data validation
4. Service Locator Pattern: Utilizes JNDI lookups through centralized constants for component discovery

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between data representation and persistence mechanisms. The component is built with standard J2EE patterns, featuring local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access. The build system supports modular development with clear dependencies, while the deployment descriptor properly configures transaction attributes and security settings. This component serves as the foundation for customer data management throughout the Pet Store application, providing a consistent and reliable way to store and retrieve customer contact information.
