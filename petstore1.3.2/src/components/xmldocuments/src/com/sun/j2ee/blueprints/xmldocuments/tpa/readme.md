# Trading Partner Agreement XML in Java Pet Store

The Trading Partner Agreement XML subproject implements XML document processing capabilities for B2B transactions within the Java Pet Store application. This Java-based module provides standardized document creation, manipulation, and serialization for trading partner agreements, focusing on invoice and supplier order documents. The subproject enables the Pet Store application to generate structured XML documents that conform to specific schemas for business-to-business integration.

This module provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document creation and manipulation for TPA invoices and supplier orders
- Schema validation (supporting both DTD and XSD)
- Standardized document serialization for B2B integration
- Line item management within TPA documents
- Consistent namespace handling across TPA document types

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Document Editor Pattern**: Implements specialized XML Document Editors (XDEs) for different document types (invoices, supplier orders)
2. **Utility-Based Composition**: Common functionality extracted to utility classes (TPALineItemUtils) for reuse across document types
3. **Consistent Namespace Management**: Standardized approach to XML namespace handling across the TPA document hierarchy
4. **Validation Support**: Flexible validation options supporting both DTD and XSD schema validation
5. **Clean API Design**: Simple, consistent interfaces for document creation and manipulation

## Overview
The architecture follows a modular approach with specialized document editors for different TPA document types. The implementation emphasizes clean separation between document structure definition and business logic, with utility classes providing shared functionality. The design supports both document creation and manipulation workflows, with consistent validation to ensure conformance with trading partner requirements. This subproject enables the Pet Store application to participate in standardized B2B transactions through well-formed XML document exchange.

## Business Functions

### XML Document Processing
- `TPAInvoiceXDE.java` : XML document editor for TPA invoices with methods to create, manipulate and serialize invoice data.
- `TPALineItemUtils.java` : Utility class for creating XML line item elements in TPA documents
- `TPASupplierOrderXDE.java` : XML document editor for TPA supplier orders in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### TPAInvoiceXDE.java

TPAInvoiceXDE implements an XML document editor for Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) invoices in the Pet Store application. It provides functionality to create, manipulate, and serialize invoice documents that conform to a specific XML schema. The class handles document creation, setting invoice properties (order ID, user ID, dates), adding line items, and serializing to various formats. Key methods include newDocument(), copyDocument(), getDocument(), setOrderId(), setUserId(), setOrderDate(), setShippingDate(), and addLineItem(). Important constants define XML namespaces, element names, and schema locations for validation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 94`: Supports both DTD and XSD validation through a configurable flag
- `Line 118`: Uses DOM manipulation to construct XML documents programmatically rather than string concatenation
- `Line 126`: Implements a flexible serialization system supporting multiple output formats (DOM Source and String)
### TPALineItemUtils.java

TPALineItemUtils provides functionality for creating XML line item elements within TPA (Trading Partner Agreement) documents. The class defines XML namespace constants and element/attribute names used in TPA line item representations. It implements a single static method, addLineItem(), which creates a properly formatted line item element with specified product details (category, product, item IDs, line number, quantity, and price) and appends it to a parent element in an XML document. The class is designed as a utility with a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 67`: Creates XML elements with proper namespace handling for TPA line items
### TPASupplierOrderXDE.java

TPASupplierOrderXDE implements an XML document editor for Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) supplier orders. It provides functionality to create, manipulate, and serialize XML documents representing supplier orders with shipping addresses and line items. The class defines XML constants, handles document creation, and offers methods to set order details like ID, date, shipping address, and line items. Important methods include newDocument(), copyDocument(), getDocument(), setOrderId(), setOrderDate(), setShippingAddress(), and addLineItem(). It supports both DTD and XSD validation through configuration options.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 84`: Uses dual validation support (DTD/XSD) through configuration parameters
- `Line 124`: Document serialization with proper namespace handling for XML standards compliance
- `Line 173`: Reuses TPALineItemUtils for line item creation, showing component modularity
