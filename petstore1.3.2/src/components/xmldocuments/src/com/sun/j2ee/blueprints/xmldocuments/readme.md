## Sub-Projects

### src/components/xmldocuments/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/xmldocuments/rsrc

The program implements core J2EE technologies including JSP, Servlets, EJB, and JMS while showcasing best practices for scalable enterprise applications. This sub-project implements XML document processing resources and schema definitions along with entity mapping configurations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document validation through DTD and XSD schema definitions
- Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) document structure standardization
- Entity catalog mapping for XML parser resolution
- Structured data exchange between system components and trading partners

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Resolution System: The EntityCatalog.properties file provides a mapping mechanism that connects public identifiers and URIs to physical file locations for XML validation
2. Modular Schema Design: DTD files are structured with external entity references to promote reuse of common elements like line items
3. Namespace Implementation: Each schema defines specific namespaces (e.g., xmlns:tpali) to ensure proper document identification and validation
4. Trading Partner Integration: Standardized document formats enable seamless data exchange between the application and external business partners

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes standardized document structures for business transactions including supplier orders, invoices, and line items. The XML schemas provide a contract for data exchange both internally and with external systems. The entity catalog system ensures that XML parsers can correctly locate and apply the appropriate validation rules, maintaining data integrity throughout the application. This foundation supports the e-commerce functionality by enabling structured representation of critical business documents in the pet store's order processing workflow.

## Business Functions

### XML Document Processing
- `XMLDocumentEditor.java` : Defines an interface for XML document manipulation with validation and entity catalog support.
- `XMLDocumentEditorFactory.java` : Factory class for creating XML document editors based on schema URIs.
- `CustomEntityResolver.java` : Custom XML entity resolver that maps entity URIs to local resources using a properties catalog
- `XMLDocumentUtils.java` : Utility class providing XML document manipulation methods for parsing, validation, transformation, and DOM operations.

### Error Handling
- `XMLDocumentException.java` : Custom exception class for XML document processing that can wrap lower-level exceptions.

### Order Management
- `ChangedOrder.java` : Represents a changed order with ID and status, providing XML serialization and deserialization capabilities.
- `OrderApproval.java` : Handles order approval data representation and XML serialization/deserialization for the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### ChangedOrder.java

ChangedOrder implements a class that represents an order that has been updated with a new status. It encapsulates order ID and status information, providing methods for XML serialization (toDOM) and deserialization (fromDOM). The class uses XMLDocumentUtils for DOM manipulation and defines constants for XML element names. Key methods include constructors, getters for order ID and status, and methods to convert between ChangedOrder objects and DOM structures. The fromDOM static factory method parses XML nodes to create ChangedOrder instances, while toDOM methods generate XML representations of the order data.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 73`: Static factory method pattern used for XML deserialization instead of constructor
- `Line 59`: Two-level DOM conversion with both document-level and node-level toDOM methods
### CustomEntityResolver.java

CustomEntityResolver implements an EntityResolver that resolves XML entities by mapping URIs to local resources. It loads entity mappings from a properties file or URL, allowing XML parsers to locate DTDs and schemas locally rather than fetching them remotely. The resolver can chain to a parent resolver and attempts multiple resolution strategies: first mapping through the catalog, then trying direct URL access, and finally falling back to resource loading. Key methods include resolveEntity(), mapEntityURI(), and resolveEntityFromURL(). Important variables include entityCatalog (Properties) and ENTITY_CATALOG (path to default mappings).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Uses a properties file to map public entity URIs to local resources
- `Line 108`: Implements a fallback chain for entity resolution with multiple strategies
- `Line 168`: Supports chaining to a parent resolver for delegation
### OrderApproval.java

OrderApproval implements a class that manages collections of changed orders for approval processing in the Pet Store application. It provides functionality for creating, manipulating, and serializing/deserializing order approval data to and from XML format. The class supports XML validation against a DTD, DOM conversion, and various XML input/output methods. Key methods include toXML(), fromXML(), toDOM(), fromDOM(), addOrder(), and getOrdersList(). Important variables include orderList (ArrayList), DTD_PUBLIC_ID, DTD_SYSTEM_ID, and XML_ORDERAPPROVAL constant.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Supports multiple XML serialization methods with optional entity catalog URL parameter
- `Line 116`: Implements static factory methods for creating OrderApproval objects from various XML sources
- `Line 149`: DOM conversion methods enable integration with XML processing libraries
### XMLDocumentEditor.java

XMLDocumentEditor defines an interface for XML document manipulation with methods to set, get, and copy XML documents. It includes a DefaultXDE implementation class that provides basic functionality for validation settings, entity catalog URL management, and XML Schema Definition (XSD) support. The interface declares methods for document operations that throw XMLDocumentException when errors occur. DefaultXDE implements these methods with placeholder implementations that throw UnsupportedOperationException, suggesting that concrete implementations should override these methods. Key methods include setDocument(), getDocument(), copyDocument(), setValidating(), and setEntityCatalogURL().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Uses JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) transformation interfaces for XML document manipulation
- `Line 50`: Provides a default implementation class within the interface definition, which is an interesting design pattern
### XMLDocumentEditorFactory.java

XMLDocumentEditorFactory implements a factory pattern for creating XMLDocumentEditor instances based on schema URIs. It maintains a catalog of schema-to-editor mappings loaded from a URL. The class provides methods to instantiate editors either by schema URI lookup or direct class name specification. Key functionality includes loading editor mappings from a URL and creating editor instances through reflection. Important methods include getXDE(String) which retrieves an editor for a specific schema, and createXDE(String) which instantiates an editor from a class name. The class handles errors by throwing XMLDocumentException.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: Uses Java reflection to dynamically instantiate editor classes based on configuration
- `Line 43`: Implements a catalog-based lookup system using Properties to map schema URIs to implementation classes
### XMLDocumentException.java

XMLDocumentException implements a custom exception class for XML document processing in the Java Pet Store application. It extends the standard Java Exception class with the ability to wrap another exception as its root cause. The class provides three constructors for different initialization scenarios: with a message and wrapped exception, with only a message, or with only a wrapped exception. Key methods include getException() to retrieve the wrapped exception and getRootCause() to recursively find the original cause of the error. The class also overrides toString() to properly display the exception chain.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 87`: Implements recursive root cause detection by checking if the wrapped exception is also an XMLDocumentException
- `Line 96`: toString() implementation delegates to the wrapped exception for consistent error reporting
### XMLDocumentUtils.java

XMLDocumentUtils is a utility class providing methods for XML document manipulation in the Java Pet Store application. It offers functionality for parsing XML documents, validating against DTDs or XML schemas, transforming documents, and manipulating DOM elements. The class includes methods for retrieving attributes and child elements from DOM nodes, creating new elements, serializing documents to XML, and deserializing XML to DOM documents. Key methods include getAttribute/getChild methods for DOM navigation, toXML/fromXML for serialization/deserialization, and createParser/createDocument/createTransformer for XML processing infrastructure. The class also defines constants for XML namespaces, schema locations, and encoding defaults, and includes utility methods for locale handling.

 **Code Landmarks**
