# XML Document Resources Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality through a simulated online pet store. The program implements core J2EE technologies including JSP, Servlets, EJB, and JMS while showcasing best practices for scalable enterprise applications. This sub-project implements XML document processing resources and schema definitions along with entity mapping configurations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document validation through DTD and XSD schema definitions
- Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) document structure standardization
- Entity catalog mapping for XML parser resolution
- Structured data exchange between system components and trading partners

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Resolution System: The EntityCatalog.properties file provides a mapping mechanism that connects public identifiers and URIs to physical file locations for XML validation
2. Modular Schema Design: DTD files are structured with external entity references to promote reuse of common elements like line items
3. Namespace Implementation: Each schema defines specific namespaces (e.g., xmlns:tpali) to ensure proper document identification and validation
4. Trading Partner Integration: Standardized document formats enable seamless data exchange between the application and external business partners

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes standardized document structures for business transactions including supplier orders, invoices, and line items. The XML schemas provide a contract for data exchange both internally and with external systems. The entity catalog system ensures that XML parsers can correctly locate and apply the appropriate validation rules, maintaining data integrity throughout the application. This foundation supports the e-commerce functionality by enabling structured representation of critical business documents in the pet store's order processing workflow.

## Business Functions

### XML Configuration
- `EntityCatalog.properties` : Entity catalog properties file mapping XML DTDs and schemas to their physical locations.

### Trading Partner Agreement Schemas
- `schemas/TPALineItem.dtd` : XML DTD schema defining the structure of TPA line items for e-commerce transactions.
- `schemas/TPASupplierOrder.dtd` : DTD schema defining XML structure for supplier orders in the TPA system.
- `schemas/TPAInvoice.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of TPA invoices for XML document validation in the Pet Store application.

## Files
### EntityCatalog.properties

EntityCatalog.properties serves as a mapping configuration file for XML document type definitions (DTDs) and XML schemas (XSDs) used throughout the Java Pet Store application. It defines the relationship between public identifiers or URIs and their corresponding physical file locations in the system. The file organizes mappings into three sections: old DTDs, new Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) DTDs and XSDs, and new component/composite DTDs. These mappings enable XML parsers to locate the correct schema definitions when validating XML documents used for purchase orders, supplier orders, invoices, line items, and other business documents within the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 9`: Transition from old DTDs to new TPA-based XML schemas shows evolution of the application's data interchange format
- `Line 14`: Use of both DTD and XSD formats for the same document types indicates support for multiple XML validation approaches
- `Line 19`: Component/Composite DTDs section demonstrates modular document structure with separate schemas for reusable components like Address and ContactInfo
### schemas/TPAInvoice.dtd

TPAInvoice.dtd defines the Document Type Definition for XML invoice documents in the Pet Store application. It establishes the structure and validation rules for invoice data exchanged between system components. The DTD defines elements including Invoice (root element), OrderId, UserId, OrderDate, ShippingDate, and LineItems. Each element has namespace attributes with a fixed URI pointing to blueprints.j2ee.sun.com/TPAInvoice. The schema imports LineItem definitions from TPALineItem.dtd using an external entity reference, allowing for modular document structure definition.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 33`: Defines a namespace attribute entity that's reused across all elements for consistent XML namespace declaration
- `Line 36-40`: Root element definition includes locale attribute with default value 'en_US', supporting internationalization
- `Line 72`: Uses external entity reference to import LineItem definitions from separate DTD file, enabling modular schema design
### schemas/TPALineItem.dtd

This DTD file defines the XML schema for Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) line items used in the Java Pet Store application. It specifies an empty LineItem element with required attributes including categoryId, productId, itemId, lineNo, quantity, and unitPrice. The schema establishes a namespace (xmlns:tpali) fixed to "http://blueprints.j2ee.sun.com/TPALineItem" for all line items. This structure enables standardized representation of order line items when exchanging data between trading partners in the e-commerce system.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 40`: Uses empty element pattern (EMPTY) with attributes rather than nested elements for data efficiency
### schemas/TPASupplierOrder.dtd

TPASupplierOrder.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) schema for XML documents representing supplier orders in the Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) system. It establishes the structure for supplier orders including order ID, date, shipping address details (name, address, contact information), and line items. The schema uses a namespace prefix 'tpaso' with a fixed URI and imports the TPALineItem.dtd schema for line item definitions. Each element is carefully defined with appropriate attributes and content models to ensure valid XML document creation for supplier order processing.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Uses entity declaration to define a namespace attribute that's reused across all elements
- `Line 106`: External entity reference imports the TPALineItem DTD for line item definitions
