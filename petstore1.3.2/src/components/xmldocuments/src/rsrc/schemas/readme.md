# XML Schema Definitions Of Java Pet Store

The XML Schema Definitions subproject is a Java-based component that provides structured data validation for XML documents used throughout the Java Pet Store application. The project implements Document Type Definition (DTD) schemas that define the structure, elements, and validation rules for various business documents exchanged within the e-commerce system. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Standardized data structure validation for business documents
- Consistent XML formatting across the application
- Local entity resolution without requiring network access
- Support for internationalization through locale attributes

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Entity Catalog System**: Centralized mapping of DTD public identifiers to physical file locations, improving parsing performance and reliability
2. **Modular Schema Design**: Reusable components like Address entities and LineItem definitions that can be imported across multiple schemas
3. **Business Document Modeling**: Comprehensive schemas for core e-commerce documents including PurchaseOrder, Invoice, and SupplierOrder
4. **Internationalization Support**: Schema elements include locale attributes to support multi-language implementations

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes a clear separation between different business document types while maintaining consistency through shared components. Each schema focuses on a specific business domain: order processing, invoicing, supplier management, and customer communications. The DTDs provide a foundation for XML-based data exchange between different components of the Pet Store application, ensuring data integrity and format consistency throughout the system. This schema-driven approach enables reliable document validation and processing in the application's various e-commerce workflows.

## Business Functions

### XML Schema Definitions
- `EntityCatalog.properties` : Entity catalog mapping DTD identifiers to their physical locations in the Java Pet Store application.
- `LineItem.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of LineItem XML documents in the Java Pet Store application.
- `SupplierOrder.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of supplier order XML documents in the Java Pet Store application.
- `Invoice.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of Invoice XML documents for the Java Pet Store application.
- `PurchaseOrder.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of purchase order XML documents in the Java Pet Store application.
- `OrderApproval.dtd` : DTD schema defining XML structure for order approval in the Java Pet Store application.
- `Mail.dtd` : DTD schema defining the structure of Mail XML documents with Address, Subject, and Content elements.

## Files
### EntityCatalog.properties

EntityCatalog.properties serves as a mapping file that associates Document Type Definition (DTD) public identifiers with their corresponding physical file locations within the Java Pet Store application. It contains three sections: old DTDs, new TPA (Trading Partner Agreement) DTDs, and new Component/Composite DTDs. Each entry maps a formal public identifier to a relative path where the DTD file can be found. This catalog enables XML parsers to resolve external entity references without requiring network access, improving parsing performance and reliability by providing local copies of all required DTDs.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-6`: Legacy DTD mappings that point to simplified paths, suggesting backward compatibility support
- `Line 9-11`: TPA-specific DTDs indicate support for business-to-business integration through Trading Partner Agreements
- `Line 14-19`: Component-based architecture evident in the organization of DTDs by business domain objects
### Invoice.dtd

This DTD file defines the XML structure for Invoice documents in the Java Pet Store application. It imports the LineItem DTD and specifies that an Invoice element must contain OrderId, UserId, OrderDate, ShippingDate elements, and one or more LineItem elements. The Invoice element has an optional locale attribute with a default value of 'en_US'. Each child element is defined to contain parsed character data (#PCDATA), establishing a clear structure for representing order invoices in the application's XML documents.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 35`: Uses entity reference to import and include the LineItem DTD, demonstrating modular DTD design
### LineItem.dtd

LineItem.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) schema for LineItem XML documents used in the Java Pet Store application. It specifies the structure and elements required for representing order line items in XML format. The DTD declares that a LineItem element must contain six child elements: CategoryId, ProductId, ItemId, LineNum, Quantity, and UnitPrice. Each of these child elements is defined to contain parsed character data (#PCDATA). This schema ensures consistent formatting of line item data for order processing within the e-commerce application.
### Mail.dtd

Mail.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) for XML documents representing email messages in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes a simple structure for mail messages with three required elements: Address (recipient email), Subject (email subject line), and Content (email body text). Each element is defined to contain parsed character data (#PCDATA). This schema ensures that XML documents representing emails conform to a consistent structure for processing within the application's messaging components.
### OrderApproval.dtd

OrderApproval.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) schema for XML documents related to order approval in the Java Pet Store application. The schema establishes a simple hierarchical structure where OrderApproval is the root element that contains one or more Order elements. Each Order element consists of two child elements: OrderId, which holds the order identifier as parsed character data, and OrderStatus, which contains the approval status. The file includes a comment noting that OrderStatus should be implemented as an attribute rather than an element.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 50`: Contains a FIXME comment indicating OrderStatus should be implemented as an attribute rather than an element, suggesting potential future refactoring.
### PurchaseOrder.dtd

PurchaseOrder.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) schema for purchase order XML documents in the Java Pet Store application. It specifies the structure and constraints for purchase order data, including elements for order details (OrderId, UserId, EmailId, OrderDate), shipping and billing addresses, total price, credit card information, and line items. The schema uses entity references to define reusable address components and imports the LineItem DTD. Each element is carefully defined with its content model, with the root PurchaseOrder element having a locale attribute defaulting to 'en_US'.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 37`: Uses entity declaration (%Address;) to define reusable address components for both shipping and billing addresses
- `Line 65`: External entity reference imports LineItem.dtd using PUBLIC identifier, demonstrating modular DTD design
### SupplierOrder.dtd

SupplierOrder.dtd defines the Document Type Definition (DTD) schema for supplier order XML documents in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes the structure and validation rules for supplier orders, including elements for order ID, order date, shipping address, and line items. The schema defines a reusable Address entity pattern containing customer information fields (name, street, city, state, country, zip) and imports the LineItem DTD from an external source. This DTD ensures that XML documents representing supplier orders conform to a standardized structure for processing within the application's supply chain management functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Uses entity declaration (%Address;) to create a reusable group of address-related elements
- `Line 59`: Imports external LineItem DTD using PUBLIC identifier, demonstrating modular DTD design
