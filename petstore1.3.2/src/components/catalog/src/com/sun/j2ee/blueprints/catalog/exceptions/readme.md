# Catalog Exception Handlers Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements exception handling mechanisms specifically for the catalog component, providing robust error management capabilities for database and system-level operations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Runtime exception handling for catalog data access operations
- System-level error propagation for irrecoverable database issues
- Clear separation between system exceptions and application logic
- Standardized error reporting for catalog component operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Runtime Exception Model: Extends Java's standard RuntimeException to create unchecked exceptions that don't require explicit handling in method signatures
2. Data Access Layer Integration: Specifically designed for use within the catalog component's DAO (Data Access Object) layer
3. Error Classification: Distinguishes system-level errors (like database connectivity issues) from business logic errors
4. Diagnostic Information Preservation: Provides constructors to capture and propagate error context information

## Overview
The architecture follows Java exception handling best practices by using unchecked exceptions for irrecoverable errors. CatalogDAOSysException serves as the primary mechanism for signaling critical system failures in the catalog's data access layer, allowing higher application layers to implement appropriate error handling strategies. This approach maintains a clean separation between normal application flow and exceptional conditions, improving code readability and maintainability while providing clear error information for troubleshooting.

## Business Functions

### Catalog Exception Handling
- `CatalogDAOSysException.java` : Custom runtime exception for catalog component data access errors

## Files
### CatalogDAOSysException.java

CatalogDAOSysException implements a runtime exception class used by the catalog component's Data Access Objects (DAOs) to handle system-level, irrecoverable errors such as SQLExceptions. The class extends Java's standard RuntimeException and provides two constructors: a default no-argument constructor and one that accepts a string parameter explaining the exception condition. This exception serves as a mechanism for propagating critical database or system errors that occur during catalog data operations.
