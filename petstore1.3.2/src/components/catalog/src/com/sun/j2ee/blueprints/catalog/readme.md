# Pet Catalog Core Subproject Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise-level e-commerce capabilities through a simulated online pet store. The Pet Catalog Core subproject implements the central product management functionality and serves as the backbone of the shopping experience. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Product catalog management with hierarchical category organization
- Inventory tracking and availability status monitoring
- Product metadata handling including descriptions, images, and pricing
- Search and filtering capabilities across the product catalog

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Architecture Implementation**: Clear separation between data models (Product, Category, Item), business logic controllers, and presentation views
2. **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern**: Abstracted database interactions through ProductDAO, CategoryDAO, and ItemDAO interfaces
3. **Caching Strategy**: Two-level caching system for frequently accessed catalog data to reduce database load
4. **Event-Driven Inventory Updates**: Asynchronous messaging for inventory changes using JMS to maintain data consistency
5. **Extensible Attribute System**: Flexible product attribute framework allowing for custom metadata on products without schema changes

## Overview
The Pet Catalog Core architecture follows J2EE best practices with EJB components handling business logic and transaction management. The catalog is structured around a three-tier model where Categories contain Products, which in turn contain Items (representing specific inventory units). The system implements lazy loading patterns for efficient resource utilization and provides both direct SQL and object-relational mapping approaches for data persistence. Integration points with other modules include the shopping cart, order processing, and search functionality, with well-defined interfaces ensuring loose coupling between components.
