# Catalog Data Models Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation demonstrating J2EE best practices for building enterprise e-commerce applications. The Catalog Data Models subproject implements the core domain entities that represent the product catalog structure, providing the foundational data layer for the application's product browsing and selection capabilities. This subproject delivers these essential capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Hierarchical product organization through categories, products, and items
- Pagination support for efficient catalog browsing
- Serializable data models for persistence and transfer
- Comprehensive product attribute management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Three-Tier Catalog Hierarchy**: The catalog is structured in a three-level hierarchy (Category → Product → Item) allowing for logical organization of the pet store inventory
2. **Pagination Infrastructure**: Built-in support for paginated results through the Page class enables efficient browsing of large product catalogs
3. **Rich Item Attributes**: The Item class supports multiple attributes and pricing information, providing comprehensive product details
4. **Serialization Support**: All model classes implement Serializable, enabling seamless transfer between application tiers and persistence layers

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean domain model approach with clear separation between the different catalog entities. Categories serve as the top-level organizational structure, containing multiple Products which represent specific types of pets. Items represent the actual inventory entries with detailed attributes and pricing information. The Page class provides infrastructure for paginated catalog browsing, essential for performance with large catalogs. These models form the foundation of the catalog subsystem, supporting both the presentation layer and business logic components of the Java Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### Product Catalog Models
- `Page.java` : Represents a paginated collection of results for iterating through data page by page.
- `Product.java` : Defines a Product class representing different types of pets within a category in the Java Pet Store application.
- `Category.java` : Represents a category of pets in the Java Pet Store application.
- `Item.java` : Represents a catalog item with product details and pricing information.

## Files
### Category.java

Category implements a serializable class representing different categories of pets in the Java Pet Store Demo. It stores basic category information including an ID, name, and description. The class provides a constructor that initializes all fields, a no-argument constructor for web tier usage, getter methods for all properties, and a toString() method for string representation. Categories serve as top-level organizational elements in the product hierarchy, with each category containing multiple products, which in turn contain inventory items.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Class implements Serializable interface, enabling it to be converted to a byte stream for persistence or network transmission
- `Line 59`: No-argument constructor specifically provided for web tier usage, facilitating JavaBean pattern compliance
### Item.java

Item implements a serializable class representing a specific item in the catalog component. Each item belongs to a product category and stores essential attributes including category, productId, productName, itemId, description, pricing information (listPrice, unitCost), and various attributes. The class provides a comprehensive constructor to initialize all properties and getter methods to access item details. Key methods include getCategory(), getProductId(), getProductName(), getAttribute() with optional index parameter, getDescription(), getItemId(), getUnitCost(), getListCost(), and getImageLocation().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Constructor accepts 13 parameters to fully initialize an item, suggesting a complex data model
- `Line 110`: getAttribute() method provides overloaded functionality with both parameterless and indexed versions
### Page.java

Page implements a serializable class that manages paginated results for the catalog component. It stores a list of objects, the starting index, and a flag indicating if more pages exist. The class provides methods to check if next/previous pages are available, retrieve the starting indices of adjacent pages, and get the page size. Key functionality includes pagination control for catalog browsing. Important elements include the EMPTY_PAGE constant, getList(), isNextPageAvailable(), isPreviousPageAvailable(), getStartOfNextPage(), getStartOfPreviousPage(), and getSize() methods.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: The class contains commented code showing evolution from size-based pagination to a simpler boolean flag approach for determining if more pages exist.
### Product.java

Product implements a serializable class representing different types of pets within a category in the Java Pet Store Demo. It stores basic product information including an ID, name, and description. The class provides two constructors - one that initializes all fields and another no-argument constructor for web tier usage. It includes getter methods for all properties and overrides toString() to display the product information in a formatted string. This simple model class serves as a fundamental data structure in the catalog component.
