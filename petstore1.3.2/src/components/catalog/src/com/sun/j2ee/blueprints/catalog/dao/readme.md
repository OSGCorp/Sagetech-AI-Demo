# Catalog Data Access Objects Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates J2EE design patterns for e-commerce functionality. The program provides catalog browsing capabilities and product purchasing workflows. This sub-project implements the data access layer for catalog operations along with an abstraction layer that supports multiple database implementations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Database-agnostic catalog data retrieval
- Internationalized product information access
- Paginated result sets for efficient data handling
- Search functionality across catalog items
- Factory pattern for implementation flexibility

## Identified Design Elements

1. DAO Interface Pattern: Clear separation between the interface (CatalogDAO) and implementations enables database portability
2. Factory-Based Implementation Selection: CatalogDAOFactory uses JNDI configuration to dynamically select the appropriate implementation
3. Internationalization Support: All data access methods accept locale parameters to retrieve localized catalog content
4. Pagination Architecture: Built-in support for retrieving manageable subsets of data through the Page model
5. Configurable SQL Statements: GenericCatalogDAO loads database-specific SQL from external configuration files

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes flexibility through the DAO pattern, allowing the application to work with different database systems without code changes. The GenericCatalogDAO provides a configurable implementation that adapts to various databases, while specialized implementations like CloudscapeCatalogDAO offer optimized access for specific database engines. The design supports internationalization at the data access level and implements efficient data retrieval through pagination. Error handling is standardized through CatalogDAOSysException, providing consistent error reporting across the catalog data layer.

## Business Functions

### Catalog Data Access
- `CatalogDAO.java` : Interface for catalog data access operations in the Java Pet Store application.
- `GenericCatalogDAO.java` : Data access object implementation for catalog operations in Java Pet Store, handling database queries for categories, products, and items.
- `CatalogDAOFactory.java` : Factory class that creates CatalogDAO instances based on deployment configuration.
- `CloudscapeCatalogDAO.java` : Database access implementation for catalog data using Cloudscape database in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### CatalogDAO.java

CatalogDAO interface defines the data access operations for the catalog component of the Java Pet Store application. It serves as a contract for database-specific implementations to retrieve catalog data including categories, products, and items. The interface provides methods for fetching individual entities by ID, paginated collections, and search functionality. All methods accept locale parameters for internationalization support and throw CatalogDAOSysException for system-level errors. Key methods include getCategory, getCategories, getProduct, getProducts, getItem, getItems, and searchItems.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Interface design pattern used to abstract database operations from business logic
- `Line 53`: All methods include Locale parameter enabling internationalization of catalog data
- `Line 71`: Page object used for pagination across all collection retrieval methods
### CatalogDAOFactory.java

CatalogDAOFactory implements a factory pattern for creating data access objects for the catalog component. It provides a static getDAO() method that instantiates the appropriate CatalogDAO implementation based on configuration stored in JNDI. The factory looks up the implementation class name from JNDINames.CATALOG_DAO_CLASS and uses reflection to create an instance. If errors occur during lookup or instantiation, the factory throws CatalogDAOSysException with detailed error messages. This approach allows the application to switch DAO implementations without code changes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 51`: Uses reflection (Class.forName().newInstance()) to dynamically instantiate the DAO implementation class specified in JNDI configuration
- `Line 49`: Implements the Factory pattern to abstract the creation of data access objects from their implementation
### CloudscapeCatalogDAO.java

CloudscapeCatalogDAO implements the CatalogDAO interface to provide database access for the catalog component of Java Pet Store. It handles SQL operations for retrieving catalog data including categories, products, and items from a Cloudscape database. The class contains methods for fetching individual records (getCategory, getProduct, getItem) and paginated collections (getCategories, getProducts, getItems), plus a search function. It uses prepared SQL statements and a DataSource obtained through ServiceLocator to establish database connections. Each method maps relational data to domain objects like Category, Product, and Item, handling locale-specific content.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 113`: Uses ServiceLocator pattern to obtain database connections, abstracting JNDI lookup details
- `Line 302`: Implements pagination with absolute positioning in ResultSet for efficient data retrieval
- `Line 359`: Complex search implementation that dynamically builds SQL queries based on tokenized keywords
### GenericCatalogDAO.java

GenericCatalogDAO implements the CatalogDAO interface to provide database access for the Catalog component of the Java Pet Store application. It loads SQL statements from an XML configuration file and dynamically builds queries based on the database type. The class handles database operations for retrieving categories, products, and items, including search functionality. It uses JNDI to obtain database connections and supports pagination through the Page model class. Key methods include getCategory(), getCategories(), getProduct(), getProducts(), getItem(), getItems(), and searchItems(), all of which accept locale parameters for internationalization. The class includes helper methods for building and executing SQL statements, with support for variable parameter substitution.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: Uses XML configuration to load database-specific SQL statements, enabling database portability
- `Line 357`: Implements dynamic SQL statement building with variable fragments for flexible query construction
- `Line 265`: Search implementation tokenizes query string and builds SQL with multiple LIKE clauses
- `Line 397`: Custom SAX parser handler with ParsingDoneException to optimize XML parsing
- `Line 129`: Connection management pattern with proper resource cleanup in closeAll() method
