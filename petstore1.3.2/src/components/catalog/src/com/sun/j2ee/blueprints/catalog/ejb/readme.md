# Catalog EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices for e-commerce systems. The Catalog EJB Components sub-project implements the core business logic and persistence layer for catalog-related functionality, serving as the backbone for product browsing and searching capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Catalog data access through a stateless session bean facade pattern
- Internationalization support via locale-specific catalog information
- Pagination functionality for efficient data retrieval
- Search capabilities across catalog items
- Clean separation between business logic and data access layers

## Identified Design Elements

1. EJB Facade Pattern: CatalogEJB implements a stateless session bean that encapsulates catalog data access operations, hiding implementation details from clients
2. Data Access Object Delegation: Business methods delegate to a CatalogDAO instance, promoting separation of concerns
3. Internationalization Support: All methods accept Locale parameters to provide localized catalog information
4. Pagination Architecture: Built-in support for retrieving subsets of data through start and count parameters
5. Exception Handling Strategy: System-level exceptions are wrapped in EJBExceptions for consistent error management

## Overview
The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with clear separation between interface and implementation. The CatalogLocal and CatalogLocalHome interfaces define the contract for local EJB access, while CatalogEJB provides the implementation. This design promotes maintainability by isolating business logic from data access concerns, supports internationalization through consistent locale handling, and enables efficient data retrieval through pagination. The component serves as a critical middleware layer connecting the presentation tier with the underlying catalog data persistence.

## Business Functions

### Catalog EJB Components
- `CatalogEJB.java` : Stateless session EJB providing catalog data access for the Java Pet Store application.
- `CatalogLocalHome.java` : Defines the local home interface for the Catalog EJB component in the Pet Store application.
- `CatalogLocal.java` : Local interface for the catalog EJB providing catalog functionality for the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### CatalogEJB.java

CatalogEJB implements a stateless session bean that serves as the business interface for accessing catalog data in the Java Pet Store application. It acts as a facade to the data access layer by delegating calls to a CatalogDAO instance. The bean provides methods to retrieve categories, products, and items with pagination support and locale-specific information. Key methods include getCategory, getCategories, getProducts, getProduct, getItems, getItem, and searchItems. The class handles CatalogDAOSysException by wrapping them in EJBException instances.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 70`: The EJB implements a facade pattern, shielding clients from direct interaction with the DAO layer
- `Line 75`: All data access methods support localization through Locale parameter, enabling internationalization
- `Line 92`: Pagination is implemented through start and count parameters for efficient data retrieval
### CatalogLocal.java

CatalogLocal interface defines the local EJB interface for catalog operations in the Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalObject and provides methods to retrieve catalog data with locale support. Key functionality includes retrieving categories, products, and items, as well as supporting pagination through the Page model object and search capabilities. Important methods include getCategory(), getCategories(), getProducts(), getProduct(), getItems(), getItem(), and searchItems(). All methods accept a Locale parameter to support internationalization and most pagination methods take start and count parameters for result set management.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 54`: All methods support internationalization by accepting a Locale parameter
- `Line 56`: Pagination is implemented through start and count parameters with Page return objects
- `Line 67`: Search functionality combines free-text search with pagination capabilities
### CatalogLocalHome.java

CatalogLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Catalog Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) in the Pet Store application's catalog component. It extends EJBLocalHome and declares a single create() method that returns a CatalogLocal object, potentially throwing a CreateException. This interface follows the EJB design pattern for local interfaces, providing a way for other components within the same JVM to locate and instantiate the Catalog EJB without the overhead of remote method invocation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: Implements the EJB local component model pattern, which provides more efficient access than remote interfaces for components in the same JVM.
