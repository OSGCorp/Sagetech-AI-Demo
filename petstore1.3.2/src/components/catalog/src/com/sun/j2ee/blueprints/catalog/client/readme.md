# Catalog Client Interface Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and e-commerce functionality. The program showcases J2EE technologies and implements best practices for scalable web applications. This sub-project implements client-side interfaces for accessing catalog services remotely along with exception handling for catalog operations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Dual access methods for catalog data (EJB and DAO)
- Paginated retrieval of catalog items, categories, and products
- Locale-aware catalog operations
- Standardized error handling for catalog operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Dual Access Strategy: Implements both EJB and direct database access (Fast Lane Reader pattern) methods for catalog operations
2. State Management: Maintains client state through bean-style properties (searchQuery, categoryId, productId, itemId)
3. Pagination Support: Provides methods to retrieve catalog data in manageable chunks with start and count parameters
4. Internationalization: Includes locale conversion utilities for supporting multiple languages
5. Exception Handling: Custom exception hierarchy for catalog-specific error conditions

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes flexibility through multiple access methods, allowing for optimal performance based on deployment scenarios. The CatalogHelper serves as the primary interface for client code to interact with catalog data, abstracting the underlying implementation details. The design supports both local and remote catalog operations while maintaining consistent error handling through the CatalogException hierarchy. This client interface is critical for the application's browsing functionality, enabling users to navigate through categories, products, and individual items in the pet store.

## Business Functions

### Catalog Access Interface
- `CatalogHelper.java` : Helper class that provides access to catalog data through either EJB or direct DAO access using the Fast Lane Reader pattern.

### Error Handling
- `CatalogException.java` : Custom exception class for catalog-related errors in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### CatalogException.java

CatalogException implements a simple custom exception class that serves as the base class for all catalog-related exceptions in the Java Pet Store application. The class extends the standard Java Exception class and implements the Serializable interface to support serialization. It provides two constructors: a default no-argument constructor and one that accepts a string message to be passed to the parent Exception class. This exception is designed to be thrown when catalog operations encounter errors.
### CatalogHelper.java

CatalogHelper implements a client-side interface for accessing catalog data in the Java Pet Store application. It provides dual access methods - either through local EJB calls or direct database access via DAO (Fast Lane Reader pattern). The class manages catalog operations including searching items, retrieving categories, products, and item details. It maintains state through bean-style properties (searchQuery, categoryId, productId, itemId, locale, count, start) and offers methods to retrieve catalog data in paginated form. Key methods include getSearchItems(), getCategories(), getProducts(), getItems(), and getItem(), each with both EJB and DAO implementations. The helper also includes utility methods for locale conversion and service location.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: Implements Fast Lane Reader pattern, allowing direct database access to bypass EJB container for performance-critical operations
- `Line 87`: Uses bean-style setters to maintain state between method calls, enabling flexible usage in JSP pages
- `Line 331`: Uses Service Locator pattern to abstract away JNDI lookup complexity for EJB access
- `Line 350`: Custom locale parsing logic to handle locale strings in format 'language_country_variant'
