# Catalog Utility Classes Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates J2EE enterprise application development best practices through an e-commerce implementation. The program showcases J2EE component integration and provides a reference architecture for scalable web applications. This sub-project implements core naming conventions and resource access patterns along with centralized configuration management for database and service components. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized database schema naming with internationalization support
- Standardized JNDI resource lookup references
- Consistent resource access patterns across application components
- Locale-specific database table name resolution

## Identified Design Elements

1. Centralized Configuration Management: Constants for database tables and JNDI resources are defined in dedicated utility classes to prevent hardcoding throughout the application
2. Internationalization Support: Database table names can be dynamically adjusted based on locale settings (US, Japanese, Chinese)
3. Resource Lookup Standardization: JNDI names for EJB homes, data sources, and configuration parameters are centralized to ensure consistency
4. Deployment Descriptor Synchronization: JNDI names are designed to align with application deployment descriptors

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes configuration centralization through utility classes that manage database naming conventions and service lookup references. The DatabaseNames class provides locale-aware table name resolution, while JNDINames serves as a central repository for service and resource references. This approach improves maintainability by eliminating scattered hardcoded values and provides a single point of change for database schema or service reference modifications. The design supports internationalization requirements and ensures consistent resource access patterns across the catalog component.

## Business Functions

### Database Utilities
- `DatabaseNames.java` : Defines database table names and provides locale-specific table name resolution for the catalog component.

### JNDI Configuration
- `JNDINames.java` : Defines JNDI naming constants for the catalog component of Java Pet Store.

## Files
### DatabaseNames.java

DatabaseNames implements a utility class that centralizes database table name constants for the catalog component of the Java Pet Store application. It defines three important table name constants: PRODUCT_TABLE, CATEGORY_TABLE, and ITEM_TABLE. The class also provides a getTableName method that handles internationalization by appending locale-specific suffixes to table names based on the provided Locale parameter, supporting US (default), Japanese, and Chinese locales. This approach prevents hardcoding table names throughout the application and centralizes the naming logic for database tables.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Implements locale-specific database table naming with suffix pattern (_ja for Japan, _zh for China)
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that centralizes JNDI naming constants for the catalog component. It provides static final String constants for EJB home objects, data sources, and application properties that are used throughout the catalog component. The class includes references to the Catalog EJB home, CatalogDB data source, and configuration parameters like CatalogDAOClass and CatalogDAOSQLURL. A private constructor prevents instantiation, enforcing the class's role as a static constant repository. These JNDI names must be synchronized with the application's deployment descriptors to ensure proper resource lookup.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: Private constructor prevents instantiation, enforcing usage as a static utility class
- `Line 47`: Constants are organized by resource type (EJB homes, datasources, application properties) for better organization
- `Line 42`: Class documentation explicitly mentions that changes here must be reflected in deployment descriptors
