# Shopping Cart Core Subproject Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality through a simulated online pet store. The program implements a complete shopping experience with product browsing, user authentication, and order processing. This sub-project implements the core shopping cart functionality along with session management for tracking user selections throughout the shopping process. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Stateful shopping cart management across user sessions
- Product selection and quantity tracking
- Price calculation and cart manipulation operations
- Cart persistence between user sessions
- Integration with the order processing pipeline

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Session-Based Cart Storage**: The implementation uses HTTP sessions to maintain cart state without requiring user login, allowing anonymous shopping experiences
2. **EJB Integration**: Shopping cart functionality is implemented as stateful session beans that integrate with the broader J2EE component architecture
3. **Value Object Pattern**: Product selections and cart items are represented as serializable value objects that can be passed between application tiers
4. **Transaction Support**: Cart operations support atomic updates within the context of the J2EE transaction model

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and persistence layers. The shopping cart core provides a foundation for the e-commerce functionality while maintaining compatibility with the MVC pattern used throughout the application. The implementation balances performance considerations with the need for reliability, ensuring cart data remains consistent even during concurrent access scenarios. The design allows for future extensions such as saved carts, wish lists, and personalized recommendations based on cart contents.

## Sub-Projects

### src/components/cart/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/cart/model

The program showcases enterprise application architecture and provides a complete online shopping experience. This sub-project implements the core data models that represent shopping cart functionality along with the item-level data structures needed for purchase transactions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Serializable shopping cart representation for session persistence
- Fine-grained item management within the cart
- Cost calculation at both item and cart levels
- Data transfer capabilities between cart instances

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Lightweight Value Objects: The models are designed as simple serializable objects with clear responsibilities focused on data representation
2. Aggregation Pattern: ShoppingCartModel serves as a container for CartItem objects, implementing collection-like behavior
3. Calculation Delegation: Total cost calculations are handled at appropriate levels with items calculating their costs and the cart aggregating them
4. Immutable Properties: The models primarily expose getter methods to maintain data integrity during cart operations

#### Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between data representation and business logic, with these models serving purely as data containers. The ShoppingCartModel provides collection management functionality while CartItem handles individual product details and per-item calculations. This design enables flexible cart manipulation, persistent storage across user sessions, and supports the e-commerce transaction flow from product selection through checkout in the broader application.

### src/components/cart/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/cart/ejb

The Shopping Cart EJB Components sub-project implements stateful session beans that manage shopping cart functionality and persistence within the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Stateful shopping cart management across user sessions
- Item addition, deletion, and quantity modification operations
- Subtotal calculation and cart item counting
- Locale-aware shopping experience
- Conversion between catalog items and cart items

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Stateful Session Bean Architecture: Implements the EJB specification to maintain user shopping cart state between requests
2. Local Interface Pattern: Uses EJBLocalObject and EJBLocalHome interfaces to define the component contract
3. Data Encapsulation: Stores cart items in a HashMap with methods controlling access and manipulation
4. Catalog Integration: Interacts with CatalogHelper to retrieve detailed product information
5. Internationalization Support: Maintains locale settings to support multi-language functionality

#### Overview
The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with clear separation between interface and implementation. ShoppingCartLocal defines the contract for cart operations, ShoppingCartLocalHome provides factory methods for cart creation, and ShoppingCartLocalEJB implements the actual functionality. The design emphasizes stateful session management, allowing the application to maintain cart contents across multiple user interactions without requiring database persistence between operations. This approach optimizes performance while ensuring data integrity throughout the shopping experience.
