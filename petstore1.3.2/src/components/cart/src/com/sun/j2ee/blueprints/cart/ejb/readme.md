# Shopping Cart EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE reference implementation that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce application architecture. The Shopping Cart EJB Components sub-project implements stateful session beans that manage shopping cart functionality and persistence within the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Stateful shopping cart management across user sessions
- Item addition, deletion, and quantity modification operations
- Subtotal calculation and cart item counting
- Locale-aware shopping experience
- Conversion between catalog items and cart items

## Identified Design Elements

1. Stateful Session Bean Architecture: Implements the EJB specification to maintain user shopping cart state between requests
2. Local Interface Pattern: Uses EJBLocalObject and EJBLocalHome interfaces to define the component contract
3. Data Encapsulation: Stores cart items in a HashMap with methods controlling access and manipulation
4. Catalog Integration: Interacts with CatalogHelper to retrieve detailed product information
5. Internationalization Support: Maintains locale settings to support multi-language functionality

## Overview
The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with clear separation between interface and implementation. ShoppingCartLocal defines the contract for cart operations, ShoppingCartLocalHome provides factory methods for cart creation, and ShoppingCartLocalEJB implements the actual functionality. The design emphasizes stateful session management, allowing the application to maintain cart contents across multiple user interactions without requiring database persistence between operations. This approach optimizes performance while ensuring data integrity throughout the shopping experience.

## Business Functions

### Shopping Cart Management
- `ShoppingCartLocalEJB.java` : Implements a shopping cart as a stateful session EJB for the Java Pet Store application.
- `ShoppingCartLocal.java` : Local EJB interface for shopping cart operations in the Java Pet Store application.
- `ShoppingCartLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the ShoppingCart EJB defining creation methods.

## Files
### ShoppingCartLocal.java

ShoppingCartLocal interface defines the local EJB contract for shopping cart operations in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalObject and provides methods to manipulate cart contents including adding items, deleting items, updating quantities, emptying the cart, and retrieving information such as the collection of items, subtotal, and item count. The interface also supports setting the user's locale preference. This interface is part of the cart component and serves as the contract that the ShoppingCart EJB implementation must fulfill.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Interface extends EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component interface that can only be accessed within the same JVM
### ShoppingCartLocalEJB.java

ShoppingCartLocalEJB implements a stateful session bean that manages a user's shopping cart in the Pet Store application. It stores cart items in a HashMap and provides methods to add, delete, update quantities, and retrieve cart items. The class interacts with the CatalogHelper to fetch item details and calculates subtotals. Key functionality includes managing cart operations, locale settings, and converting catalog items to cart items. Important methods include getItems(), addItem(), deleteItem(), updateItemQuantity(), getCount(), getSubTotal(), and empty(). The class maintains a HashMap cart and Locale locale as its main state variables.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 76`: The getItems() method demonstrates integration between cart and catalog components by converting catalog items to cart items
- `Line 114`: The updateItemQuantity() method intelligently removes items when quantity is zero or negative
- `Line 123`: The getSubTotal() method calculates the cart total by iterating through items and multiplying unit cost by quantity
### ShoppingCartLocalHome.java

ShoppingCartLocalHome interface defines the home interface for the Shopping Cart EJB component in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating ShoppingCartLocal objects. The interface declares a single create() method that throws CreateException, allowing clients to instantiate new shopping cart instances. There is also a commented-out create method that would accept a HashMap parameter, suggesting a potential feature for initializing a cart with existing items. This interface is part of the cart component's EJB implementation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: Interface extends EJBLocalHome, making it a local home interface in the EJB 2.0 component model
- `Line 52`: Commented-out create method suggests a planned feature for initializing carts with existing items
