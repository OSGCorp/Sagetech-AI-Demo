# Shopping Cart Data Models Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates e-commerce functionality through a reference implementation of J2EE technologies. The program showcases enterprise application architecture and provides a complete online shopping experience. This sub-project implements the core data models that represent shopping cart functionality along with the item-level data structures needed for purchase transactions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Serializable shopping cart representation for session persistence
- Fine-grained item management within the cart
- Cost calculation at both item and cart levels
- Data transfer capabilities between cart instances

## Identified Design Elements

1. Lightweight Value Objects: The models are designed as simple serializable objects with clear responsibilities focused on data representation
2. Aggregation Pattern: ShoppingCartModel serves as a container for CartItem objects, implementing collection-like behavior
3. Calculation Delegation: Total cost calculations are handled at appropriate levels with items calculating their costs and the cart aggregating them
4. Immutable Properties: The models primarily expose getter methods to maintain data integrity during cart operations

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between data representation and business logic, with these models serving purely as data containers. The ShoppingCartModel provides collection management functionality while CartItem handles individual product details and per-item calculations. This design enables flexible cart manipulation, persistent storage across user sessions, and supports the e-commerce transaction flow from product selection through checkout in the broader application.

## Business Functions

### Shopping Cart Components
- `ShoppingCartModel.java` : Implements a model class for shopping cart data in the Java Pet Store application.
- `CartItem.java` : Represents a single item in a shopping cart with product details and quantity.

## Files
### CartItem.java

CartItem implements a serializable class representing a line item in a shopping cart. It stores essential product information including itemId, productId, category, name, attribute, quantity, and unitCost. The class provides getter methods for all properties and calculates the total cost by multiplying quantity by unit cost. This simple data model serves as a fundamental building block for the shopping cart functionality in the Java Pet Store application, enabling the storage and manipulation of items selected by users for purchase.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 78`: getTotalCost() method dynamically calculates the total cost by multiplying quantity and unitCost rather than storing it as a field
### ShoppingCartModel.java

ShoppingCartModel implements a serializable model class that represents shopping cart data in the Java Pet Store application. It stores a collection of CartItem objects and provides methods to access cart information. Key functionality includes retrieving the cart size, getting the collection of items, iterating through items, calculating the total cost of all items in the cart, and copying data from another ShoppingCartModel instance. Important methods include getSize(), getCart(), getItems(), getTotalCost(), and copy(). The class serves as a value object with fine-grained getter methods for the shopping cart component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 55`: The class implements Serializable to support state persistence across HTTP sessions
- `Line 61`: Provides two constructors - one that accepts items collection and another no-arg constructor specifically for web tier usage
- `Line 86`: The copy() method performs a shallow copy, which could lead to shared references between cart instances
