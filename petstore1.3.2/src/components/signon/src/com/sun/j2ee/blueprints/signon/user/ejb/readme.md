# Sign On J2EE User EJB Blueprint Of Java Pet Store

The Sign On J2EE User EJB Blueprint is a Java EE component that implements the authentication subsystem for the Java Pet Store application. The subproject utilizes Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology to provide secure user credential management and authentication services. This component follows the standard EJB architecture pattern with entity beans and container-managed persistence (CMP) to handle user data storage and retrieval operations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure user authentication and credential validation
- Container-managed persistence for user data
- Standardized interfaces for application-wide authentication
- Validation logic for username and password constraints

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements a standard J2EE Entity Bean model with container-managed persistence for user data
2. Local Interface Pattern: Uses EJB local interfaces to optimize performance for in-container authentication calls
3. Data Validation: Enforces business rules for credential creation including length constraints and character restrictions
4. Separation of Concerns: Clear division between interface definitions and implementation logic

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with a three-part EJB structure: implementation class (UserEJB), local interface (UserLocal), and local home interface (UserLocalHome). This design provides a clean separation between the authentication business logic and data access concerns. The component handles user creation, retrieval, and credential validation while leveraging container services for transaction management and security. The implementation enforces consistent validation rules and provides a standardized authentication mechanism that can be used throughout the Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### User Authentication
- `UserEJB.java` : Entity bean for user authentication in the signon component of Java Pet Store.
- `UserLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the User entity EJB in the signon component.
- `UserLocal.java` : Local interface for the User EJB that defines methods for user authentication and password management.

## Files
### UserEJB.java

UserEJB implements an Entity Bean for user authentication in the Java Pet Store application. It manages user credentials with container-managed persistence (CMP) fields for username and password. The class provides methods for creating users with validation logic that enforces maximum length constraints and character restrictions. It includes a matchPassword method to verify user credentials and implements standard EntityBean lifecycle methods required by the EJB specification. Key elements include ejbCreate for user creation with validation, abstract getter/setter methods for CMP fields, and the matchPassword business method.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 59`: Implements validation logic for username and password during user creation
- `Line 79`: Simple password matching method that compares plain text passwords
### UserLocal.java

UserLocal interface defines the local EJB contract for user authentication in the Java Pet Store's sign-on component. It provides methods to retrieve and modify user credentials, including getUserName(), getPassword(), setPassword(), and matchPassword() for password validation. The interface also defines constants for maximum username and password lengths (25 characters each). As part of the EJB architecture, it extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it accessible to other components within the same JVM for user authentication operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component interface that can only be accessed within the same JVM
### UserLocalHome.java

UserLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the User Entity EJB in the Java Pet Store's signon component. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding User entities in the database. The interface declares three key methods: create() for creating a new user with username and password, findByPrimaryKey() for retrieving a specific user by username, and findAllUsers() for retrieving all users. These methods are essential for managing user authentication data in the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: This interface is part of the EJB 2.0 local interface pattern, providing more efficient access than remote interfaces for components within the same JVM.
