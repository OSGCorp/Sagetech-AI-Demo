## Sign On J2EE Blueprints

The Sign On J2EE Blueprints is a Java-based authentication subsystem for the Java Pet Store application. The subproject implements user authentication and credential management through Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) architecture. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure user authentication and validation
- Container-managed persistence for user credentials
- Standardized user entity access through local interfaces
- Password matching and verification services

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Entity Bean Architecture**: Implements a container-managed persistence (CMP) Entity Bean model for user data storage and retrieval
2. **Credential Validation Logic**: Enforces security constraints including character restrictions and maximum length validation (25 characters)
3. **Local Interface Pattern**: Uses the EJB local interface pattern to optimize performance for same-JVM component interactions
4. **Separation of Interface and Implementation**: Clear separation between interface contracts (UserLocal, UserLocalHome) and implementation (UserEJB)

## Overview
The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with a three-part EJB design: implementation class (UserEJB), local interface (UserLocal), and local home interface (UserLocalHome). The Entity Bean manages persistence automatically through container services, while business logic focuses on credential validation and authentication. The design emphasizes security through input validation and provides a clean API for other application components to authenticate users. This modular approach allows the authentication system to be maintained independently while providing essential services to the broader Pet Store application.

## Sub-Projects

### src/components/signon/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/signon/web

The Src Web sub-project implements the web-facing authentication and security components that control access to protected resources within the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- User authentication and session management
- Role-based access control for protected resources
- XML-driven security configuration
- User registration and account creation

#### Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Security Configuration: Security constraints, protected resources, and authentication pages are defined in XML and loaded dynamically
2. EJB Integration: Authentication logic is delegated to SignOn EJBs, maintaining separation between web and business tiers
3. Filter-Based Security: Uses servlet filters to intercept requests and enforce security constraints before reaching protected resources
4. Session-Based Authentication: Maintains user authentication state in HTTP sessions with optional "remember me" cookie functionality

#### Overview

The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers. The SignOnFilter intercepts incoming requests and validates them against protected resource definitions loaded by SignOnDAO from XML configuration. The CreateUserServlet handles new user registration, while the ProtectedResource class models security constraints. This design provides flexible, declarative security that can be modified without code changes, supporting both form-based authentication and programmatic access control throughout the application.

### src/components/signon/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/signon/user/ejb

The subproject utilizes Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology to provide secure user credential management and authentication services. This component follows the standard EJB architecture pattern with entity beans and container-managed persistence (CMP) to handle user data storage and retrieval operations. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure user authentication and credential validation
- Container-managed persistence for user data
- Standardized interfaces for application-wide authentication
- Validation logic for username and password constraints

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements a standard J2EE Entity Bean model with container-managed persistence for user data
2. Local Interface Pattern: Uses EJB local interfaces to optimize performance for in-container authentication calls
3. Data Validation: Enforces business rules for credential creation including length constraints and character restrictions
4. Separation of Concerns: Clear division between interface definitions and implementation logic

#### Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with a three-part EJB structure: implementation class (UserEJB), local interface (UserLocal), and local home interface (UserLocalHome). This design provides a clean separation between the authentication business logic and data access concerns. The component handles user creation, retrieval, and credential validation while leveraging container services for transaction management and security. The implementation enforces consistent validation rules and provides a standardized authentication mechanism that can be used throughout the Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### User Authentication
- `user/ejb/UserEJB.java` : Entity bean for user authentication in the signon component of Java Pet Store.
- `user/ejb/UserLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the User entity EJB in the signon component.
- `user/ejb/UserLocal.java` : Local interface for the User EJB that defines methods for user authentication and password management.

## Files
### user/ejb/UserEJB.java

UserEJB implements an Entity Bean for user authentication in the Java Pet Store application. It manages user credentials with container-managed persistence (CMP) fields for username and password. The class provides methods for creating users with validation logic that enforces maximum length constraints and character restrictions. It includes a matchPassword method to verify user credentials and implements standard EntityBean lifecycle methods required by the EJB specification. Key elements include ejbCreate for user creation with validation, abstract getter/setter methods for CMP fields, and the matchPassword business method.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 59`: Implements validation logic for username and password during user creation
- `Line 79`: Simple password matching method that compares plain text passwords
### user/ejb/UserLocal.java

UserLocal interface defines the local EJB contract for user authentication in the Java Pet Store's sign-on component. It provides methods to retrieve and modify user credentials, including getUserName(), getPassword(), setPassword(), and matchPassword() for password validation. The interface also defines constants for maximum username and password lengths (25 characters each). As part of the EJB architecture, it extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it accessible to other components within the same JVM for user authentication operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component interface that can only be accessed within the same JVM
### user/ejb/UserLocalHome.java

UserLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the User Entity EJB in the Java Pet Store's signon component. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding User entities in the database. The interface declares three key methods: create() for creating a new user with username and password, findByPrimaryKey() for retrieving a specific user by username, and findAllUsers() for retrieving all users. These methods are essential for managing user authentication data in the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: This interface is part of the EJB 2.0 local interface pattern, providing more efficient access than remote interfaces for components within the same JVM.
