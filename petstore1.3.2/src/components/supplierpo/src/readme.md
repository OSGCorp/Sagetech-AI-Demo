# Supplier Purchase Order Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE platform. The program implements a complete e-commerce system and showcases integration between various J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements supplier purchase order management along with XML-based data exchange capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Purchase order lifecycle management (pending, approved, denied, completed)
- XML document serialization and deserialization for supplier communications
- Entity relationship management between orders, line items, and shipping information
- Container-managed persistence for order data

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Uses container-managed persistence (CMP) with four key entity beans (SupplierOrder, ContactInfo, Address, LineItem) with defined relationships
2. XML Integration: Comprehensive XML handling with DTD validation for data exchange with supplier systems
3. Status-based Workflow: Implements a state machine for purchase orders with well-defined transitions
4. Component Modularity: Clear separation of concerns with dependencies managed through manifest declarations

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes J2EE best practices through its use of entity beans with container-managed persistence and relationships. The component handles the complete lifecycle of supplier purchase orders from creation through fulfillment. XML document handling provides a standardized interface for supplier communications, while the entity relationships maintain data integrity. The build system ensures proper dependency management with other components like XMLDocuments and ServiceLocator. This modular design allows for maintainability while supporting the core business function of supplier order management within the larger Pet Store application.

## Files
### build.xml

This build.xml file defines the Ant build process for the SupplierPO component, which handles supplier purchase orders in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes targets for initialization, compilation, EJB JAR creation, client JAR creation, documentation generation, and cleanup. The script manages dependencies on other components like XMLDocuments, ServiceLocator, ContactInfo, Address, and LineItem. Key targets include 'init' (setting properties), 'compile', 'ejbjar', 'ejbclientjar', 'clean', 'components' (building dependencies), 'docs' (generating JavaDocs), and 'core' (main build target).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 104`: Copies classes from dependent components into the build directory rather than referencing them as external dependencies
- `Line 130`: Creates separate client JAR by selectively excluding server-side implementation classes
- `Line 172`: Builds documentation that includes source from multiple component directories
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplierpo/ejb/JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that centralizes the JNDI naming constants used throughout the supplier purchase order system. It defines static final String constants for various Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) including ContactInfo, Address, LineItem, and SupplierOrder. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation since it only serves as a container for constants. These JNDI names are critical reference points that must match the corresponding entries in deployment descriptors, ensuring consistent lookup of EJB resources across the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Private constructor prevents instantiation of this utility class that only contains constants
- `Line 51-56`: All JNDI names use the java:comp/env/ namespace prefix, following J2EE best practices for portable EJB references
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplierpo/ejb/OrderStatusNames.java

OrderStatusNames implements a utility class that centralizes the definition of constants representing the possible states of a supplier purchase order in the system. It defines four string constants: PENDING (for orders placed but not approved), APPROVED (for orders that have been approved), DENIED (for rejected orders), and COMPLETED (for fulfilled orders). The class documentation explains the typical order state transitions: orders start as pending, then either move to approved and eventually completed, or are denied.
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplierpo/ejb/SupplierOrder.java

SupplierOrder implements a data model for purchase orders sent to suppliers in the Pet Store application. It stores order information including order ID, date, shipping details, and line items. The class provides comprehensive XML serialization and deserialization capabilities using DOM and SAX, with validation against a DTD schema.

### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplierpo/ejb/SupplierOrderLocalHome.java

SupplierOrderLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the SupplierOrder EJB in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding supplier orders in the system. The interface includes three key methods: create() for creating new supplier orders, findByPrimaryKey() for retrieving orders by their ID, and findOrdersByStatus() for querying orders based on their current status. This interface is part of the supplier purchase order component and has no remote interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: This EJB is explicitly designed with only a local interface, indicating it's meant for internal component access rather than remote client access.
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplierpo/rsrc/schemas/SupplierOrder.dtd

SupplierOrder.dtd defines the XML document structure for supplier purchase orders in the Java Pet Store application. It specifies the elements and their relationships for representing orders sent to suppliers. The DTD declares four main elements: SupplierOrder (the root element containing order details), OrderId (order identifier), OrderDate (when order was placed), and ShippingInfo (delivery information). It also imports external DTD definitions for ContactInfo and LineItem elements through entity references. The schema ensures that supplier orders follow a consistent structure with required order metadata and one or more line items.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 38`: Uses entity references to import external DTD definitions, promoting modular schema design
- `Line 36`: Requires at least one LineItem element with the '+' occurrence indicator, ensuring valid orders always contain items
### ejb-jar-manifest.mf

This manifest file defines the configuration for the supplierpo EJB JAR component. It specifies the manifest version (1.0) and declares dependencies on two external JAR files: xmldocuments.jar and servicelocator.jar. These dependencies are essential for the supplierpo component to function properly within the Java Pet Store application.
### ejb-jar.xml

This ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor defines the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) for the supplier purchase order component of Java Pet Store. It configures four main entity beans: SupplierOrderEJB, ContactInfoEJB, AddressEJB, and LineItemEJB. The file establishes container-managed persistence (CMP) for these beans, defining their fields, relationships, and transaction attributes. Key relationships include one-to-one mappings between SupplierOrder and ContactInfo, ContactInfo and Address, and a one-to-many relationship between SupplierOrder and LineItem. The descriptor also specifies method permissions (all unchecked) and detailed transaction attributes for each bean's methods. The deployment descriptor enables finding orders by status through an EJB-QL query and implements cascade delete for dependent relationships.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 83`: One-to-one relationship between SupplierOrder and ContactInfo with cascade-delete, ensuring dependent objects are removed when parent is deleted.
- `Line 12`: EJB-QL query implementation for finding orders by status, demonstrating container query language usage.
- `Line 209`: Relationship definitions show how complex object graphs are maintained through container-managed relationships.
