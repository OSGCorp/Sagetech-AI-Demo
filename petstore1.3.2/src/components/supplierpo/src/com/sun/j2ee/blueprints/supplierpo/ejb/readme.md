# Supplier PO EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java enterprise application that demonstrates e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and backend order processing system. This sub-project implements the supplier purchase order management system along with XML-based data exchange capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Entity bean representation of supplier purchase orders
- Order status tracking and state management
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange with suppliers
- Comprehensive order data management including line items and shipping details
- JNDI-based resource lookup for enterprise components

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements the EJB entity bean pattern with local interfaces for efficient in-container access to purchase order data
2. Status-Based Workflow: Orders follow a defined lifecycle (PENDING → APPROVED → COMPLETED or DENIED) managed through constants
3. XML Integration: Comprehensive XML handling with both DOM and SAX support for supplier data exchange
4. Relationship Management: Maintains one-to-many relationship with line items and one-to-one with contact information
5. Data Transfer Objects: Uses value objects to transfer order data between application tiers

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between interfaces and implementation, with entity beans providing persistent data storage. The component uses a well-defined state model for order processing workflow and provides comprehensive XML handling for integration with external supplier systems. The design follows J2EE best practices with proper encapsulation of JNDI names and status constants, making the system maintainable and extensible while supporting the core supplier order management functionality of the Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### Purchase Order Management
- `SupplierOrderEJB.java` : Entity bean for managing supplier purchase orders in the Java Pet Store application.
- `SupplierOrderLocal.java` : Local interface for SupplierOrder EJB defining methods to manage purchase orders to suppliers.
- `OrderStatusNames.java` : Defines constants for supplier purchase order status values in the Java Pet Store application.
- `SupplierOrder.java` : SupplierOrder class represents purchase orders sent to suppliers with order details, shipping information, and line items.
- `SupplierOrderLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the SupplierOrder EJB defining creation and finder methods.

### System Configuration
- `JNDINames.java` : Defines JNDI names for EJB components in the supplier purchase order system.

## Files
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that centralizes the JNDI naming constants used throughout the supplier purchase order system. It defines static final String constants for various Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) including ContactInfo, Address, LineItem, and SupplierOrder. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation since it only serves as a container for constants. These JNDI names are critical reference points that must match the corresponding entries in deployment descriptors, ensuring consistent lookup of EJB resources across the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Private constructor prevents instantiation of this utility class that only contains constants
- `Line 51-56`: All JNDI names use the java:comp/env/ namespace prefix, following J2EE best practices for portable EJB references
### OrderStatusNames.java

OrderStatusNames implements a utility class that centralizes the definition of constants representing the possible states of a supplier purchase order in the system. It defines four string constants: PENDING (for orders placed but not approved), APPROVED (for orders that have been approved), DENIED (for rejected orders), and COMPLETED (for fulfilled orders). The class documentation explains the typical order state transitions: orders start as pending, then either move to approved and eventually completed, or are denied.
### SupplierOrder.java

SupplierOrder implements a data model for purchase orders sent to suppliers in the Pet Store application. It stores order information including order ID, date, shipping details, and line items. The class provides comprehensive XML serialization and deserialization capabilities using DOM and SAX, with validation against a DTD schema. Key functionality includes creating, manipulating, and converting supplier orders between object and XML representations. Important methods include toXML(), fromXML(), toDOM(), and fromDOM() for XML handling, along with standard getters and setters for order properties. The class uses ContactInfo and LineItem classes to represent shipping information and ordered items respectively.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 66`: Uses SimpleDateFormat for consistent date formatting in XML serialization
- `Line 141`: Implements multiple XML serialization methods with different output targets (Result, String)
- `Line 187`: Provides static factory methods for creating SupplierOrder objects from XML sources
- `Line 226`: DOM manipulation for XML serialization without relying on JAXB
- `Line 243`: Complex DOM parsing logic to reconstruct object hierarchy from XML elements
### SupplierOrderEJB.java

SupplierOrderEJB implements an entity bean that manages supplier purchase orders in the Java Pet Store application. It maintains relationships with LineItemEJB (one-to-many) and ContactInfoEJB (one-to-one). The class provides methods for accessing and modifying purchase order details including ID, date, status, contact information, and line items. Key functionality includes creating purchase orders, adding line items, and retrieving order data. Important methods include ejbCreate(), ejbPostCreate(), addLineItem(), getAllItems(), and getData(). The class also implements standard EntityBean lifecycle methods.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 156`: Creates and manages complex relationships between entities during ejbPostCreate, establishing connections to ContactInfo and LineItem entities
- `Line 184`: getAllItems() method provides a workaround for web tier access to CMR fields without transactions
- `Line 199`: getData() method implements a transfer object pattern to expose entity data to clients
### SupplierOrderLocal.java

SupplierOrderLocal interface defines the local EJB interface for managing supplier purchase orders in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalObject and provides methods to access and modify purchase order data including ID, date, status, shipping information, and line items. The interface includes getters and setters for purchase order fields, methods to manage associated ContactInfo objects, and functionality to add and retrieve line items. Key methods include getPoId(), setPoStatus(), getContactInfo(), addLineItem(), getData(), and getAllItems(), enabling comprehensive management of supplier orders within the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Interface extends EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component interface accessible only within the same container
- `Line 67`: Uses ContactInfoLocal interface showing composition relationship between supplier orders and contact information
- `Line 72`: Collection return type for line items demonstrates a one-to-many relationship pattern
### SupplierOrderLocalHome.java

SupplierOrderLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the SupplierOrder EJB in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding supplier orders in the system. The interface includes three key methods: create() for creating new supplier orders, findByPrimaryKey() for retrieving orders by their ID, and findOrdersByStatus() for querying orders based on their current status. This interface is part of the supplier purchase order component and has no remote interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: This EJB is explicitly designed with only a local interface, indicating it's meant for internal component access rather than remote client access.
