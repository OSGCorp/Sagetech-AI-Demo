# Customer Profile EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Customer Profile EJB Components is a Java subproject that manages user preferences and profile information within the Java Pet Store application. The subproject implements a container-managed persistence (CMP) entity bean architecture to store and retrieve customer preferences in a database. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Persistent storage of user preferences
- Customization of user experience based on stored preferences
- Local EJB interface for efficient in-JVM component access
- Serializable data transfer objects for client-server communication

## Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence: Utilizes J2EE CMP entity beans where the container automatically handles database operations
2. Local Interface Pattern: Implements EJBLocalObject interfaces to optimize performance for in-container access
3. Data Transfer Objects: Uses serializable ProfileInfo class to transfer preference data between tiers
4. Default Preference Management: Provides default values for all user preferences to ensure consistent application behavior

## Overview
The architecture follows a standard J2EE entity bean pattern with clear separation between interface and implementation. The ProfileEJB class manages four key user preferences: preferred language, favorite product category, MyList preference, and banner display preference. These preferences are exposed through the ProfileLocal interface, while the ProfileLocalHome interface provides factory methods for creating and finding profile instances. The ProfileInfo class serves as a lightweight data transfer object for moving preference data between application tiers. This design enables efficient customization of the user experience while maintaining J2EE best practices.

## Business Functions

### Customer Profile Management
- `ProfileInfo.java` : Serializable data class for storing user profile preferences in the Java Pet Store application.
- `ProfileEJB.java` : Entity bean for managing user profile preferences in the Java Pet Store application.
- `ProfileLocal.java` : Local interface for the Profile EJB defining user preferences in the Java Pet Store application.
- `ProfileLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for Profile EJB defining creation and finder methods with default preferences.

## Files
### ProfileEJB.java

ProfileEJB implements a container-managed persistence (CMP) entity bean that stores user profile preferences for the Java Pet Store application. It manages four key user preferences: preferred language, favorite category, myList preference, and banner preference. The class provides abstract getter and setter methods for these CMP fields, which are automatically implemented by the EJB container. It also implements required EntityBean lifecycle methods including ejbCreate for initialization, ejbPostCreate, and standard methods for entity context management. This bean serves as the persistence layer for storing customer profile preferences in the database.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Uses abstract methods for CMP fields, letting the EJB container generate the implementation
- `Line 59`: EntityBean implementation with minimal business logic, focusing on data persistence
### ProfileInfo.java

ProfileInfo implements a serializable data class that encapsulates a customer's profile preferences in the Java Pet Store application. It stores four key user preferences: preferred language, favorite product category, and boolean flags for MyList and banner display preferences. The class provides a constructor to initialize these preferences and getter methods to access them. It also includes a toString() method for debugging and display purposes. This class serves as a data transfer object between the customer profile EJB and client applications.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Class implements Serializable interface to support EJB remote method calls and persistence
### ProfileLocal.java

ProfileLocal defines a local interface for the Profile Enterprise JavaBean in the customer component of Java Pet Store. It provides methods to access and modify user preferences including language preference, favorite product category, and boolean flags for MyList and Banner features. The interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component accessible within the same JVM. Key methods include getPreferredLanguage(), setPreferredLanguage(), getFavoriteCategory(), setFavoriteCategory(), getMyListPreference(), setMyListPreference(), getBannerPreference(), and setBannerPreference().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject indicating this is a local EJB interface that can only be accessed within the same JVM
### ProfileLocalHome.java

ProfileLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Profile Enterprise JavaBean in the customer profile component. It extends EJBLocalHome and declares default values for user preferences including language, favorite category, and display preferences. The interface provides two key methods: create() for instantiating new Profile beans with specified preference parameters, and findByPrimaryKey() for retrieving existing Profile beans. These methods enable client code to interact with Profile EJBs through the local interface within the same JVM, avoiding remote call overhead.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Defines default values as public static final constants that can be referenced by other classes without instantiation
