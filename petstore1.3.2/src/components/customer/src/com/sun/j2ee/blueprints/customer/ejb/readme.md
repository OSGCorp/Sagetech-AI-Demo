# Customer Core EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE 1.3 platform. This sub-project implements the core customer management functionality through Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), providing a persistent data layer for customer information. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) for customer data storage
- Container-Managed Relationships (CMR) for associating customers with accounts and profiles
- Local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access to customer entities
- Standard entity lifecycle management through EJB container

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Uses the EJB entity bean model with container-managed persistence to abstract database operations
2. Relationship Management: Implements CMR to maintain referential integrity between customer, account, and profile entities
3. Local Interface Pattern: Employs EJBLocalObject and EJBLocalHome interfaces to optimize in-container access performance
4. Composite Entity Pattern: Customer entity acts as an aggregate root for related account and profile information

## Overview
The architecture follows the J2EE entity bean pattern with the CustomerEJB implementing the core persistence logic, while CustomerLocal and CustomerLocalHome interfaces provide the contract for client interactions. The design emphasizes separation of concerns by isolating customer data management from business logic and presentation layers. This component serves as the foundation for customer-related operations throughout the application, enabling features like user registration, profile management, and account maintenance while leveraging container services for transaction management and persistence.

## Business Functions

### Customer Management
- `CustomerEJB.java` : Entity bean implementation for customer management in the Java Pet Store application.
- `CustomerLocal.java` : Local EJB interface defining customer access methods for the Java Pet Store application.
- `CustomerLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for Customer EJB defining creation and finder methods.

## Files
### CustomerEJB.java

CustomerEJB implements an entity bean that manages customer data in the Java Pet Store application. It uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) to store customer information and Container-Managed Relationships (CMR) to associate customers with their accounts and profiles. The class defines abstract getter/setter methods for the userId field and relationships with AccountLocal and ProfileLocal entities. The ejbCreate and ejbPostCreate methods initialize a new customer by creating associated Account and Profile entities through their respective local home interfaces. Standard EntityBean lifecycle methods are also implemented.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 69`: Uses Container-Managed Relationships (CMR) to maintain associations between customer, account, and profile entities
- `Line 78`: ejbPostCreate method demonstrates J2EE dependency lookup pattern using JNDI to obtain local EJB references
- `Line 81`: Creates default account and profile entities with predefined constants during customer creation
### CustomerLocal.java

CustomerLocal interface defines the local EJB interface for customer data access in the Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject and provides methods to access customer information through three key methods: getUserId() to retrieve the customer identifier, getAccount() to access the customer's account information through AccountLocal, and getProfile() to access the customer's profile information through ProfileLocal. This interface serves as a contract for local EJB client interactions with customer data.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Uses EJB local interfaces (introduced in EJB 2.0) for optimized same-JVM component communication
### CustomerLocalHome.java

CustomerLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Customer Enterprise JavaBean in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding Customer entities within the application's persistence layer. The interface declares three key methods: create() for instantiating new customer entities with a userId, findByPrimaryKey() to locate specific customers by their userId, and findAllCustomers() to retrieve all customer records. These methods throw standard EJB exceptions (CreateException and FinderException) to handle error conditions during entity creation and lookup operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: Extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome, indicating this is a local interface for container-managed EJB access
