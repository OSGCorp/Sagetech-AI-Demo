# Customer Management Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices for e-commerce systems. The program implements customer account management and product catalog functionality along with order processing capabilities. This sub-project implements the customer data management layer along with profile preference handling. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Customer account persistence and retrieval
- User profile preferences management
- Contact information and address storage
- Credit card data handling and association with accounts
- Entity relationships with cascading delete operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence (CMP): Entity beans leverage the J2EE container for automatic persistence of customer data, profiles, accounts, and related information
2. Container-Managed Relationships (CMR): Defined relationships between entities (Customer-Profile, Customer-Account, Account-ContactInfo, etc.) with appropriate cascade operations
3. Local Interface Architecture: Uses EJBLocalObject and EJBLocalHome interfaces to optimize performance by avoiding remote call overhead
4. Data Transfer Objects: Implements serializable classes like ProfileInfo to transfer data between EJB layer and client applications

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between entity definitions and their implementations. The customer management component is structured around six key entity beans (CustomerEJB, ProfileEJB, AccountEJB, ContactInfoEJB, AddressEJB, and CreditCardEJB) that work together to provide comprehensive customer data management. Each entity has well-defined relationships, allowing for efficient data access patterns and maintaining data integrity through appropriate cascade operations. The build process is managed through Ant, with clear dependencies and component packaging defined for both server and client deployments.

## Sub-Projects

### src/components/customer/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/customer/profile/ejb

The subproject implements a container-managed persistence (CMP) entity bean architecture to store and retrieve customer preferences in a database. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Persistent storage of user preferences
- Customization of user experience based on stored preferences
- Local EJB interface for efficient in-JVM component access
- Serializable data transfer objects for client-server communication

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence: Utilizes J2EE CMP entity beans where the container automatically handles database operations
2. Local Interface Pattern: Implements EJBLocalObject interfaces to optimize performance for in-container access
3. Data Transfer Objects: Uses serializable ProfileInfo class to transfer preference data between tiers
4. Default Preference Management: Provides default values for all user preferences to ensure consistent application behavior

#### Overview
The architecture follows a standard J2EE entity bean pattern with clear separation between interface and implementation. The ProfileEJB class manages four key user preferences: preferred language, favorite product category, MyList preference, and banner display preference. These preferences are exposed through the ProfileLocal interface, while the ProfileLocalHome interface provides factory methods for creating and finding profile instances. The ProfileInfo class serves as a lightweight data transfer object for moving preference data between application tiers. This design enables efficient customization of the user experience while maintaining J2EE best practices.
