# Email Service Exception Handlers Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture patterns for e-commerce systems. The program implements a complete online pet store with shopping cart functionality and order processing capabilities. This sub-project implements specialized exception handling for the email notification system along with custom error propagation mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Custom exception types for email-related errors
- Structured error propagation for mail sending failures
- Consistent exception handling patterns for the notification subsystem

## Identified Design Elements

1. Exception Inheritance: The custom exception classes extend Java's standard Exception class to maintain compatibility with Java's exception handling mechanisms
2. Descriptive Error Reporting: Exception constructors accept detailed error messages to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting
3. Specialized Error Types: Custom exceptions provide semantic meaning about the specific failure modes in the email subsystem
4. Cross-Cutting Error Handling: Exceptions serve as a cross-cutting concern that spans across the email service components

## Overview
The architecture follows Java exception handling best practices by creating specialized exception types for the email notification system. MailerAppException serves as the primary exception class for mail-related failures, providing both default and message-based constructors. This approach enables more precise error handling throughout the application, allowing for targeted exception catching and appropriate error responses. The exception design supports the overall reliability of the email notification system by providing clear error boundaries and failure reporting.

## Business Functions

### Email Service Exceptions
- `MailerAppException.java` : Custom exception class for the mailer component to handle mail sending failures.

## Files
### MailerAppException.java

MailerAppException implements a custom exception class for the mailer component in the Java Pet Store application. It extends the standard Java Exception class and is thrown when there are failures during mail sending operations. The class provides two constructors: a default constructor that takes no arguments and another constructor that accepts a string parameter to explain the exception condition. This exception helps in error handling and propagation within the mailer component's workflow.
