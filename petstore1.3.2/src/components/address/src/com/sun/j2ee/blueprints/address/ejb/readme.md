# Address Management EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Address Management EJB Components is a Java subproject that provides persistent address data management capabilities within the Java Pet Store e-commerce application. The components implement the Entity Bean pattern using Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) to handle customer shipping and billing address information. This subproject creates a clean separation between the data access layer and business logic, allowing for standardized address handling throughout the application.

The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with:

- Entity bean implementation for persistent address storage
- Local interfaces for efficient in-container access
- Value object pattern for data transfer between layers
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Container-Managed Persistence**: Leverages J2EE container capabilities for automatic persistence of address entities without manual SQL handling
2. **Value Object Pattern**: Uses the Address class as a data transfer object between presentation and persistence layers
3. **XML Data Exchange**: Supports XML serialization and deserialization for integration with external systems
4. **Multiple Creation Patterns**: Provides flexible entity creation methods supporting different initialization scenarios

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns through the EJB component model. Address data is encapsulated in a dedicated entity bean with standardized access patterns. The design supports both direct field-by-field manipulation and bulk operations through the Address value object. XML capabilities enable integration with external systems while maintaining the integrity of the address data model. This component serves as the foundation for all address-related operations throughout the Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### Address Management
- `AddressEJB.java` : Entity bean implementation for managing address information in the Java Pet Store application.
- `AddressLocalHome.java` : EJB local home interface for Address entity bean in the Java Pet Store application.
- `Address.java` : Represents a physical address with street, city, state, country and zipcode information.
- `AddressLocal.java` : Local interface for the Address EJB component defining address data access methods.

## Files
### Address.java

Address implements a class for storing and managing physical address information in the Java Pet Store application. It contains fields for street names, city, state, zip code, and country, with corresponding getter and setter methods. The class provides XML serialization and deserialization capabilities through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods, allowing addresses to be converted to and from XML DOM nodes. Constants define XML element names and DTD information for validation. The class supports two-line street addresses and includes a toString() method for debugging.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 127`: XML deserialization handles optional second street name element gracefully
- `Line 118`: XML serialization conditionally includes second street name only when it exists
### AddressEJB.java

AddressEJB implements an entity bean that manages address information in the Java Pet Store application. It provides container-managed persistence (CMP) for address fields including street names, city, state, zip code, and country. The class defines abstract getter and setter methods for these fields, multiple ejbCreate methods for different initialization scenarios, and a getData method that returns an Address value object. It also implements standard EntityBean lifecycle methods required by the EJB specification. The bean serves as the persistence layer for customer and shipping addresses in the e-commerce application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) with abstract getter/setter methods rather than managing database operations directly
- `Line 95`: Provides an overloaded ejbCreate method that accepts an Address value object for convenient initialization
- `Line 106`: getData method implements the Value Object pattern to transfer address data between tiers
### AddressLocal.java

AddressLocal interface extends EJB's EJBLocalObject to define the local interface for the Address Enterprise JavaBean component. It provides getter and setter methods for address attributes including street names, city, state, zip code, and country. The interface also includes a getData() method that returns an Address object containing all the address information. This interface serves as the contract for local clients to interact with the Address EJB within the Java Pet Store application's address component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Uses EJBLocalObject interface for local container-managed persistence access, avoiding remote call overhead
### AddressLocalHome.java

AddressLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Address entity bean in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding Address entity beans. Key functionality includes three create methods: one accepting individual address components (streetName1, streetName2, city, state, zipCode, country), another accepting an Address object, and a no-argument create method. It also includes a findByPrimaryKey method to locate existing Address entities by their primary key.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: This interface follows the EJB design pattern where home interfaces provide factory methods for entity beans
