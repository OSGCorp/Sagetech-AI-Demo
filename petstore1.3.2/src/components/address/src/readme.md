# Customer Address Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE 1.3 platform. This sub-project implements the address management functionality along with persistence and data transfer capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Entity bean persistence for customer and shipping addresses
- XML serialization and deserialization of address data
- Standardized address format with support for international addresses
- Component-based architecture for address management

## Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence (CMP 2.x): The address component uses EJB 2.x CMP for data persistence, abstracting database operations from business logic
2. Value Object Pattern: Address.java serves as a data transfer object between presentation and persistence layers
3. XML Integration: Built-in XML serialization/deserialization with DTD validation ensures data integrity and interoperability
4. Flexible Creation Methods: Multiple ejbCreate methods support different initialization scenarios for address objects
5. Separation of Concerns: Clear distinction between entity bean implementation (AddressEJB), local interfaces (AddressLocal, AddressLocalHome), and data transfer objects (Address)

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with a well-defined entity bean for persistence, clean interfaces for local access, and a value object for data transfer. The build process is managed through Ant, supporting compilation, packaging, and documentation generation. The component handles address validation, storage, and retrieval while maintaining compatibility with XML-based data exchange. This modular design allows the address functionality to be used across multiple aspects of the Pet Store application, including customer profiles and order shipping information.

## Sub-Projects

### src/components/address/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/ejb

The components implement the Entity Bean pattern using Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) to handle customer shipping and billing address information. This subproject creates a clean separation between the data access layer and business logic, allowing for standardized address handling throughout the application.

The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with:

- Entity bean implementation for persistent address storage
- Local interfaces for efficient in-container access
- Value object pattern for data transfer between layers
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Container-Managed Persistence**: Leverages J2EE container capabilities for automatic persistence of address entities without manual SQL handling
2. **Value Object Pattern**: Uses the Address class as a data transfer object between presentation and persistence layers
3. **XML Data Exchange**: Supports XML serialization and deserialization for integration with external systems
4. **Multiple Creation Patterns**: Provides flexible entity creation methods supporting different initialization scenarios

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns through the EJB component model. Address data is encapsulated in a dedicated entity bean with standardized access patterns. The design supports both direct field-by-field manipulation and bulk operations through the Address value object. XML capabilities enable integration with external systems while maintaining the integrity of the address data model. This component serves as the foundation for all address-related operations throughout the Pet Store application.

## Files
### build.xml

This build.xml file defines the build process for the Address component in the Java Pet Store application. It sets up properties for directories, dependencies, and build targets. Key functionality includes compiling Java classes, creating EJB JAR files, generating documentation, and managing dependencies with other components like XMLDocuments. Important targets include init, compile, ejbjar, ejbclientjar, clean, components, docs, and core. The script manages paths for source code, compiled classes, and documentation while handling EJB packaging requirements.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 102`: Creates separate client JAR by excluding implementation classes, following EJB best practices for deployment
- `Line 65`: Establishes dependency on XMLDocuments component for PO/Invoice classes, showing component architecture
- `Line 76`: Configures classpath to include J2EE libraries and dependent components for proper compilation
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/ejb/Address.java

Address implements a class for storing and managing physical address information in the Java Pet Store application. It contains fields for street names, city, state, zip code, and country, with corresponding getter and setter methods. The class provides XML serialization and deserialization capabilities through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods, allowing addresses to be converted to and from XML DOM nodes. Constants define XML element names and DTD information for validation. The class supports two-line street addresses and includes a toString() method for debugging.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 127`: XML deserialization handles optional second street name element gracefully
- `Line 118`: XML serialization conditionally includes second street name only when it exists
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/ejb/AddressEJB.java

AddressEJB implements an entity bean that manages address information in the Java Pet Store application. It provides container-managed persistence (CMP) for address fields including street names, city, state, zip code, and country. The class defines abstract getter and setter methods for these fields, multiple ejbCreate methods for different initialization scenarios, and a getData method that returns an Address value object. It also implements standard EntityBean lifecycle methods required by the EJB specification. The bean serves as the persistence layer for customer and shipping addresses in the e-commerce application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) with abstract getter/setter methods rather than managing database operations directly
- `Line 95`: Provides an overloaded ejbCreate method that accepts an Address value object for convenient initialization
- `Line 106`: getData method implements the Value Object pattern to transfer address data between tiers
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/ejb/AddressLocal.java

AddressLocal interface extends EJB's EJBLocalObject to define the local interface for the Address Enterprise JavaBean component. It provides getter and setter methods for address attributes including street names, city, state, zip code, and country. The interface also includes a getData() method that returns an Address object containing all the address information. This interface serves as the contract for local clients to interact with the Address EJB within the Java Pet Store application's address component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Uses EJBLocalObject interface for local container-managed persistence access, avoiding remote call overhead
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/ejb/AddressLocalHome.java

AddressLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Address entity bean in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding Address entity beans. Key functionality includes three create methods: one accepting individual address components (streetName1, streetName2, city, state, zipCode, country), another accepting an Address object, and a no-argument create method. It also includes a findByPrimaryKey method to locate existing Address entities by their primary key.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: This interface follows the EJB design pattern where home interfaces provide factory methods for entity beans
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/address/rsrc/schemas/Address.dtd

This DTD file defines the XML schema for the Address structure used in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes the structure and elements required for representing postal addresses. The schema defines an Address element containing child elements for address components: StreetName (which can appear up to twice), City, State, ZipCode, and an optional Country element. Each child element is defined to contain parsed character data (#PCDATA). This schema provides standardization for address data representation throughout the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 41`: The DTD allows for two StreetName elements, supporting multi-line street addresses
### ejb-jar.xml

This ejb-jar.xml file defines the deployment descriptor for the Address component in the Java Pet Store application. It configures an entity bean named AddressEJB with container-managed persistence (CMP 2.x) that stores address information. The file declares six CMP fields: zipCode, streetName1, streetName2, city, state, and country. It specifies local interfaces (AddressLocalHome and AddressLocal) and sets security permissions allowing unchecked access to all bean methods. The assembly descriptor configures transaction attributes, requiring transactions for all data access methods. The bean supports multiple create methods, including one that accepts an Address object and another that takes individual address components.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 58`: Uses container-managed persistence (CMP) 2.x, indicating a J2EE 1.3+ compliant entity bean implementation
- `Line 59`: Abstract schema name 'Address' is used for EJB QL queries in a CMP entity bean
- `Line 91`: Security configuration uses unchecked permissions, allowing any authenticated user to access all methods
- `Line 179`: Multiple create methods with different signatures provide flexible ways to instantiate address objects
