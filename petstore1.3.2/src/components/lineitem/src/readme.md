## Line Item Component Of Java Pet Store

The Line Item Component is a Java EJB-based module that implements the order line item functionality within the Java Pet Store application. The component uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) Entity Beans to represent individual items within customer orders. This subproject provides essential e-commerce functionality by managing product selections, quantities, pricing, and shipping status tracking. The component implements both data persistence and business logic for line items through the J2EE Entity Bean architecture.

This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Order item management with complete product reference information
- Quantity and pricing calculations for order processing
- Shipping status tracking for fulfillment workflows
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange

## Identified Design Elements

1. **EJB Container-Managed Persistence**: Leverages J2EE CMP for automatic persistence of line item data without manual database operations
2. **Local Interface Architecture**: Implements EJBLocalObject pattern for efficient in-container access to line item entities
3. **XML Data Exchange**: Provides XML serialization through DOM manipulation for interoperability with other system components
4. **Transfer Object Pattern**: Uses LineItem class as a data transfer object to encapsulate line item data for business logic operations

## Overview
The architecture follows standard J2EE patterns with clear separation between interface and implementation. The LineItemEJB class implements the core business logic while the LineItem class serves as both a data transfer object and XML serialization handler. The component is built using Ant with dependencies on the XMLDocuments component for document processing. This design enables seamless integration with order processing, inventory management, and the overall e-commerce workflow of the Java Pet Store application.

The component provides a comprehensive representation of products within orders, tracking essential information such as product identification, quantities, pricing, and shipping status.

This subproject implements Entity Bean patterns following J2EE specifications with these capabilities:

- Complete product identification through category, product, and item IDs
- Order-specific data tracking including line numbers and quantities
- Financial information management with unit pricing
- Shipping status monitoring with shipped quantity tracking
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **EJB Component Architecture**: Follows standard Entity Bean patterns with clear separation between implementation (LineItemEJB) and interfaces (LineItemLocal, LineItemLocalHome)
2. **Local-Only Access**: Designed for internal application use with no remote interfaces
3. **Data Transfer Objects**: Uses LineItem class as a model/transfer object to move data between layers
4. **XML Integration**: Supports XML serialization through DOM manipulation for data exchange and persistence

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes J2EE best practices with proper separation of concerns between interfaces and implementation. The LineItem component provides a foundation for order management within the application, handling both the persistence aspects through the EJB container and the business logic for line item operations. The design facilitates integration with other components through well-defined interfaces and data transfer objects.

## Files
### build.xml

This build.xml file defines the Ant build process for the LineItem component in the Java Pet Store application. It establishes build targets for compiling, cleaning, generating documentation, and building dependent components. The script sets up directory structures, classpaths, and compilation parameters, with dependencies on the XMLDocuments component. Key targets include 'init' for property setup, 'compile' for source compilation, 'components' for building dependencies, 'docs' for JavaDoc generation, and 'core' as the default target that builds the complete component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Defines component dependencies showing the hierarchical structure of the Pet Store application
- `Line 73`: Creates a classpath that combines local classes with external J2EE dependencies
- `Line 87`: Includes resource files in the build output alongside compiled classes
### com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/lineitem/ejb/LineItem.java

LineItem implements a class representing a single item in an order, storing product identification (categoryId, productId, itemId), line number, quantity, and unit price. The class provides getters and setters for all properties, and implements XML serialization/deserialization through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods. It defines XML constants for element and attribute names used in the document structure, and includes DTD identifiers for validation. The class works with XMLDocumentUtils for DOM manipulation, enabling conversion between Java objects and XML representations for persistence and data exchange.
