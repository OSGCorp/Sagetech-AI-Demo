## Line Item EJB in Java Pet Store

The Line Item EJB is a critical data layer component of the Java Pet Store application that manages individual order items. Implemented as an Entity Bean within the J2EE architecture, this subproject handles the persistence and business logic for order line items. The component provides a comprehensive representation of products within orders, tracking essential information such as product identification, quantities, pricing, and shipping status.

This subproject implements Entity Bean patterns following J2EE specifications with these capabilities:

- Complete product identification through category, product, and item IDs
- Order-specific data tracking including line numbers and quantities
- Financial information management with unit pricing
- Shipping status monitoring with shipped quantity tracking
- XML serialization/deserialization for data exchange

## Identified Design Elements

1. **EJB Component Architecture**: Follows standard Entity Bean patterns with clear separation between implementation (LineItemEJB) and interfaces (LineItemLocal, LineItemLocalHome)
2. **Local-Only Access**: Designed for internal application use with no remote interfaces
3. **Data Transfer Objects**: Uses LineItem class as a model/transfer object to move data between layers
4. **XML Integration**: Supports XML serialization through DOM manipulation for data exchange and persistence

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes J2EE best practices with proper separation of concerns between interfaces and implementation. The LineItem component provides a foundation for order management within the application, handling both the persistence aspects through the EJB container and the business logic for line item operations. The design facilitates integration with other components through well-defined interfaces and data transfer objects.

## Business Functions

### Order Management
- `LineItemEJB.java` : Entity bean implementation for line items in an order, managing product details and quantities.
- `LineItemLocal.java` : Local interface for LineItem EJB defining methods to access order line item data in the Java Pet Store application.
- `LineItem.java` : Represents a line item in an order with product details and quantity information.
- `LineItemLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for LineItem EJB defining creation and finder methods.

## Files
### LineItem.java

LineItem implements a class representing a single item in an order, storing product identification (categoryId, productId, itemId), line number, quantity, and unit price. The class provides getters and setters for all properties, and implements XML serialization/deserialization through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods. It defines XML constants for element and attribute names used in the document structure, and includes DTD identifiers for validation. The class works with XMLDocumentUtils for DOM manipulation, enabling conversion between Java objects and XML representations for persistence and data exchange.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 136`: Uses XMLDocumentUtils helper class to build DOM nodes from object properties
- `Line 145`: Static factory method parses XML DOM into LineItem objects with validation
### LineItemEJB.java

LineItemEJB implements an Entity Bean representing a line item in an order within the Java Pet Store application. It manages product information (category, product, item IDs), quantities, pricing, and shipping status. The class provides abstract getter/setter methods for all properties and implements standard EJB lifecycle methods. Key functionality includes creating line items, retrieving line item data as a transfer object, and tracking shipped quantities. Important methods include ejbCreate(), getData(), and the various abstract accessors/mutators for line item properties.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 134`: Uses a Data Transfer Object pattern to convert entity bean data to a serializable object
- `Line 114`: Provides overloaded ejbCreate methods to support different creation scenarios
- `Line 91`: Tracks both total quantity and shipped quantity separately for order fulfillment
### LineItemLocal.java

LineItemLocal defines a local interface for the LineItem Enterprise JavaBean that represents an individual item in an order. It extends EJBLocalObject and provides methods to access line item properties such as category ID, product ID, item ID, line number, quantity, unit price, and quantity shipped. The interface also includes methods to set the quantity shipped and retrieve the complete line item data as a LineItem object. This interface is part of the line item component in the Java Pet Store application and has no remote interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: The interface is explicitly designed as local-only (no remote interface) which optimizes for performance in the same JVM
### LineItemLocalHome.java

LineItemLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the LineItem EJB in the Java Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding LineItem entities. The interface includes two create methods: one that takes individual parameters (catId, prodId, itemId, lineNo, qty, price, qtyShipped) and another that accepts a LineItem object with quantity. It also defines a findByPrimaryKey method to locate LineItem entities by their primary key. This interface is part of the EJB component architecture and has no remote interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: This EJB explicitly declares it has no remote interface, indicating it's designed for local container-managed access only
