# Process Manager Control EJBs Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE platform. The program implements a complete e-commerce workflow and showcases component-based development using Enterprise JavaBeans. This sub-project implements order processing state management along with workflow control for the fulfillment process. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Order status tracking through the fulfillment lifecycle
- Persistent storage of order processing state
- Query capabilities for orders by status
- Local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access

## Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence (CMP): The entity beans leverage J2EE container services for data persistence, simplifying data access operations
2. Local Interface Pattern: Uses the EJB 2.0 local interface pattern to optimize performance for in-container clients
3. Status-Based Workflow: Orders are managed through a state-based workflow system tracked in persistent storage
4. Entity-Based Data Model: Core order processing data is represented as entity beans with well-defined lifecycle methods

## Overview
The architecture follows the standard EJB design pattern with clear separation between implementation (ManagerEJB), local interface (ManagerLocal), and home interface (ManagerLocalHome). This component serves as the data persistence layer for the order processing workflow, providing reliable state tracking throughout the order fulfillment process. The design allows for efficient querying of orders by status, enabling workflow management components to process batches of orders in similar states.

## Business Functions

### Process Management
- `ManagerEJB.java` : Entity bean for managing order processing status in the Java Pet Store application.
- `ManagerLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the ProcessManager Entity EJB that defines creation and finder methods.
- `ManagerLocal.java` : Local interface for Manager EJB defining order status operations in the process manager component.

## Files
### ManagerEJB.java

ManagerEJB implements an entity bean that tracks order processing status within the process manager component. It provides container-managed persistence (CMP) for order tracking with fields for orderId and status. The class implements required EntityBean lifecycle methods including ejbCreate, ejbPostCreate, and context management methods. The bean serves as a persistent data store for order processing state, allowing the system to track order status throughout the fulfillment workflow.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53-54`: Uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) with abstract getter/setter methods that the EJB container implements at runtime
- `Line 57-61`: Implementation of ejbCreate returns null rather than the primary key, as the container handles key generation for CMP entity beans
### ManagerLocal.java

ManagerLocal defines a local interface for the Manager EJB in the process manager component. This interface extends EJBLocalObject and provides methods for accessing and modifying order information. It includes three key methods: getOrderId() to retrieve the order identifier, getStatus() to retrieve the current status of an order, and setStatus() to update the order status. The interface is part of the process management functionality in the Java Pet Store application, allowing local EJB clients to interact with order processing operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: This interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, indicating it's designed for local (same JVM) EJB access rather than remote calls
### ManagerLocalHome.java

ManagerLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the ProcessManager Entity EJB in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding process manager entities. The interface includes create() method to instantiate a new process manager with an order ID and status, findByPrimaryKey() to locate a specific process manager by order ID, and findOrdersByStatus() to retrieve collections of orders with a particular status. These methods throw standard EJB exceptions like CreateException and FinderException when operations fail.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: This interface is part of the EJB local component model, which provides higher performance for components deployed in the same container
