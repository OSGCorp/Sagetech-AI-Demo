# Subproject Process Workflow Transitions Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and e-commerce functionality. The program processes orders and manages workflow states through a flexible transition system. This sub-project implements a state transition framework along with exception handling mechanisms for workflow processing. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Dynamic workflow state management
- Flexible transition delegation pattern
- XML-based message processing for workflow transitions
- Exception handling with cause chaining

## Identified Design Elements

1. Delegate Pattern Implementation: The TransitionDelegate interface establishes a contract for transition handlers, promoting loose coupling and extensibility
2. Factory-Based Object Creation: TransitionDelegateFactory uses reflection to dynamically instantiate appropriate delegate implementations
3. Data Encapsulation: TransitionInfo serves as a container for XML messages, supporting both single messages and batches
4. Exception Chaining: TransitionException implements sophisticated exception handling with root cause tracking

## Overview
The architecture follows a factory-delegate pattern that enables flexible workflow transitions within the order processing system. The TransitionDelegate interface defines the contract for transition handlers, while the TransitionDelegateFactory dynamically instantiates appropriate implementations. Data is passed through the system using TransitionInfo objects that encapsulate XML messages. The framework includes robust exception handling through the TransitionException class, which supports exception chaining to preserve the original error context. This design allows for extensible workflow management with clear separation between transition logic and the core process management system.

## Business Functions

### Process Management
- `TransitionInfo.java` : Encapsulates parameters passed to transition delegates in the process manager component.
- `TransitionDelegate.java` : Defines the interface for transition delegates in the process manager component.
- `TransitionDelegateFactory.java` : Factory class for creating TransitionDelegate instances in the process manager component.

### Error Handling
- `TransitionException.java` : Custom exception class for handling transition errors in the process manager component.

## Files
### TransitionDelegate.java

TransitionDelegate interface defines the contract for classes that handle transitions in the process manager component. It requires implementing classes to provide two methods: setup() for initialization and doTransition(TransitionInfo) for executing the actual transition logic. Both methods can throw TransitionException when errors occur. This interface is part of the transitions package within the process manager component and serves as a foundation for implementing various transition handlers in the Java Pet Store application.
### TransitionDelegateFactory.java

TransitionDelegateFactory implements a simple factory class for creating TransitionDelegate instances in the Java Pet Store application's process manager component. The class provides a method to instantiate TransitionDelegate objects dynamically based on a provided class name using Java reflection. It contains a default constructor and a single method getTransitionDelegate() that takes a class name as a string parameter, attempts to instantiate the class, and returns the created delegate object. If instantiation fails, it wraps the exception in a TransitionException.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 49`: Uses Java reflection (Class.forName().newInstance()) to dynamically instantiate delegate classes based on their string class names
### TransitionException.java

TransitionException implements a custom exception class for the process manager's transition system. It extends the standard Java Exception class with the ability to wrap another exception, providing a mechanism for chaining exceptions. The class offers three constructors: one with a message and wrapped exception, one with just a message, and one with just a wrapped exception. Key methods include getException() to retrieve the wrapped exception and getRootCause() to recursively find the original cause. The toString() method is overridden to display the wrapped exception's details when available.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 87`: Implements recursive exception unwrapping to find the root cause of an error
- `Line 96`: Custom toString() implementation that delegates to the wrapped exception for better error reporting
### TransitionInfo.java

TransitionInfo implements a class that encapsulates parameters passed to transition delegates in the process management system. It stores XML messages either as individual strings or as collections (batches). The class provides three constructors to initialize with either a single XML message, a batch of XML messages, or both. It offers two getter methods: getXMLMessage() to retrieve the single XML message and getXMLMessageBatch() to retrieve the collection of XML messages. This simple data container facilitates the transfer of XML-formatted data through the process manager's transition system.
