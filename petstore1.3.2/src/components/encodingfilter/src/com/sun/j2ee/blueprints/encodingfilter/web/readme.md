# Web Character Encoding Filter Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application development patterns and best practices. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases J2EE component integration. This sub-project implements character encoding management for HTTP requests along with internationalization support. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Consistent character encoding across all HTTP requests
- Configurable encoding settings through filter parameters
- Prevention of character corruption in multilingual content
  - Support for non-ASCII character sets
  - Proper handling of international user input

## Identified Design Elements

1. Servlet Filter Implementation: Leverages the J2EE Filter interface to intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach application servlets
2. Configuration-Driven Encoding: Uses filter initialization parameters to determine the target character encoding
3. Default Fallback Mechanism: Provides ASCII as a default encoding when no specific configuration is provided
4. Request Processing: Intercepts and modifies HttpServletRequest objects to ensure proper character encoding

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices by implementing cross-cutting concerns as filters, separating internationalization concerns from business logic. The filter is designed to be lightweight and efficient, processing only the character encoding aspect of requests without interfering with other request properties. This approach ensures that all components in the application receive properly encoded requests, preventing character corruption issues in multilingual environments while maintaining compatibility with various client types.

## Business Functions

### Character Encoding
- `EncodingFilter.java` : A servlet filter that sets character encoding for HTTP requests.

## Files
### EncodingFilter.java

EncodingFilter implements a J2EE servlet filter that ensures consistent character encoding for HTTP requests. It reads the target encoding from filter configuration parameters and applies it to each incoming request. The filter implements the standard Filter interface with init(), destroy(), and doFilter() methods. The doFilter() method casts the ServletRequest to HttpServletRequest and sets its character encoding to the configured value before passing the request down the filter chain. By default, the encoding is set to ASCII if no configuration is provided.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 69`: Sets character encoding on the request before passing it down the filter chain, preventing encoding issues with form submissions
