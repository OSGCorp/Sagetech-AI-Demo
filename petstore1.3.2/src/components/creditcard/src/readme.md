# Credit Card Processing Source Root Of Java Pet Store

The Credit Card Processing Source Root is a Java-based component that provides essential credit card data management and persistence functionality for the Java Pet Store application. The component implements a container-managed persistence (CMP) Entity Bean architecture to securely store and process credit card information. This sub-project handles credit card validation, storage, and retrieval operations, providing these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Structured credit card data representation and persistence
- XML-based data serialization and deserialization
- Standardized interfaces for credit card entity creation and retrieval
- Formatted access to credit card components (number, type, expiry date)

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements a CMP 2.x entity bean model for credit card data persistence with local interfaces
2. XML Data Representation: Provides standardized DTD-based schema for credit card information exchange
3. Transfer Object Pattern: Uses the CreditCard class as a data transfer object between application layers
4. Component-Based Build System: Utilizes Ant for building, packaging, and deploying the credit card component

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between interface and implementation. The CreditCardEJB entity bean manages persistence concerns while the CreditCard class handles data representation and XML transformation. Local interfaces (CreditCardLocal and CreditCardLocalHome) provide standardized access points for other application components. The build system supports component-level compilation, packaging, and documentation generation, making the credit card processing functionality a well-encapsulated, reusable module within the larger Java Pet Store application.

- Standardized credit card information representation and validation
- XML serialization/deserialization for credit card data
- Local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access to credit card entities

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements the standard EJB container-managed persistence model with clear separation between interfaces and implementation
2. Data Transfer Objects: Uses the CreditCard class as a value object to transfer credit card data between application layers
3. XML Integration: Provides XML serialization/deserialization capabilities for interoperability with external systems
4. Flexible Creation Patterns: Multiple factory methods in the home interface accommodate different creation scenarios

#### Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with a clear separation between interfaces (CreditCardLocal, CreditCardLocalHome) and implementation (CreditCardEJB). The CreditCard class serves as both a data model and transfer object, supporting XML operations for integration purposes. The component uses container-managed persistence for data integrity and transaction management, while providing a clean API for other application components to interact with credit card information.
