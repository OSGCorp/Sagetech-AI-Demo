# Credit Card Processing EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE 1.3 platform. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases component-based development using Enterprise JavaBeans. This sub-project implements the credit card processing functionality through entity beans and data models that handle payment information storage and validation.  This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure credit card data persistence through container-managed persistence (CMP)
- Standardized credit card information representation and validation
- XML serialization/deserialization for credit card data
- Local EJB interfaces for efficient in-container access to credit card entities

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Bean Architecture: Implements the standard EJB container-managed persistence model with clear separation between interfaces and implementation
2. Data Transfer Objects: Uses the CreditCard class as a value object to transfer credit card data between application layers
3. XML Integration: Provides XML serialization/deserialization capabilities for interoperability with external systems
4. Flexible Creation Patterns: Multiple factory methods in the home interface accommodate different creation scenarios

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with a clear separation between interfaces (CreditCardLocal, CreditCardLocalHome) and implementation (CreditCardEJB). The CreditCard class serves as both a data model and transfer object, supporting XML operations for integration purposes. The component uses container-managed persistence for data integrity and transaction management, while providing a clean API for other application components to interact with credit card information.

## Business Functions

### Credit Card Processing
- `CreditCardEJB.java` : Entity bean implementation for credit card data storage and retrieval in the Java Pet Store application.
- `CreditCard.java` : Implements a credit card data model with XML serialization capabilities for the Java Pet Store application.
- `CreditCardLocalHome.java` : Defines the local home interface for the CreditCard EJB component in the Java Pet Store application.
- `CreditCardLocal.java` : Local interface for the CreditCard EJB defining credit card data access methods.

## Files
### CreditCard.java

CreditCard implements a data model class for credit card information in the Java Pet Store application. It stores credit card details including card number, expiry date, and card type. The class provides getter and setter methods for these properties and implements XML serialization/deserialization functionality through toDOM() and fromDOM() methods. It defines XML constants for document structure and includes DTD identifiers for validation. The class interacts with XMLDocumentUtils for DOM manipulation and handles XML document exceptions when parsing credit card data from DOM nodes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 101`: XML serialization method converts credit card data to DOM structure
- `Line 108`: Static fromDOM method provides factory pattern implementation for creating CreditCard objects from XML nodes
- `Line 46`: Class defines DTD constants for XML validation of credit card data
### CreditCardEJB.java

CreditCardEJB implements an entity bean for managing credit card information in the Java Pet Store application. It provides container-managed persistence (CMP) for credit card data including card number, type, and expiry date. The class offers methods to create credit card entities, retrieve formatted expiry month/year values, and access the complete credit card data through a transfer object. It implements the standard EntityBean lifecycle methods required by the EJB specification and provides utility methods for parsing expiry date strings.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 62`: Uses a transfer object pattern with CreditCard class to encapsulate entity data for client access
- `Line 87`: Implements helper methods to parse expiry date string into month and year components
- `Line 45`: Uses Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) with abstract accessor methods
### CreditCardLocal.java

CreditCardLocal defines a local interface for the CreditCard Enterprise JavaBean in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject and provides methods to access and modify credit card information. The interface includes getter and setter methods for card number, card type, and expiry date, with additional methods to retrieve expiry month and year separately. It also includes a getData() method that returns a CreditCard object containing all the credit card information. This interface is part of the credit card processing component of the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: The interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, indicating it's designed for local (same JVM) EJB access rather than remote calls
### CreditCardLocalHome.java

CreditCardLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the CreditCard Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) component in the Java Pet Store application. It extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding CreditCard EJB instances. The interface includes three create methods with different parameter options: one with no parameters, one accepting card details (number, type, expiry date), and one accepting a CreditCard object. It also provides a findByPrimaryKey method to locate existing credit card entities by their primary key.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: Interface extends EJBLocalHome, indicating this is a local component interface for container-managed EJBs in the J2EE architecture
