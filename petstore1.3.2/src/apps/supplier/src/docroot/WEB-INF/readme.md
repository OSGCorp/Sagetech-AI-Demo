# Supplier Web Application Configuration Of Java Pet Store

The Supplier Web Application Configuration is a Java-based component of the Java Pet Store application that manages supplier inventory interactions and data population. This subproject implements the web deployment descriptor and resource configurations that enable secure supplier operations and order fulfillment integration. It provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure inventory management through role-based access control
- JMS-based communication for order processing
- Integration with EJB components for order fulfillment
- Servlet-based request processing for supplier operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Role-Based Security Model: The configuration enforces administrator-level access requirements for supplier inventory operations through form-based authentication
2. Resource Integration: Establishes connections to JMS resources and EJB components to facilitate order processing and inventory management
3. Dual-Purpose Servlet Architecture: Separates request processing (RcvrRequestProcessor) from data population (PopulateServlet) for cleaner separation of concerns
4. Configurable Transition Delegates: Environment entries allow for customizable workflow transitions between application components

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes security through role-based access controls, maintains integration with enterprise components via JMS and EJB references, and provides a structured approach to handling supplier operations. The configuration is designed for maintainability and security, with clear separation between inventory management and data population functions, ensuring that only authorized administrators can access sensitive supplier operations.

## Business Functions

### Configuration Files
- `web.xml` : Web application deployment descriptor for the Supplier module of Java Pet Store.

## Files
### web.xml

This web.xml file configures the web application deployment descriptor for the Supplier module of the Java Pet Store. It defines two servlets: RcvrRequestProcessor for handling supplier inventory requests and PopulateServlet for data population. The file establishes servlet mappings, session configuration, JMS resource references, security constraints requiring administrator role for accessing RcvrRequestProcessor, form-based authentication, and EJB local references to OrderFulfillmentFacade and Inventory components. It also includes environment entries for transition delegates and sets a welcome file.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 94`: Security constraint implementation restricting access to RcvrRequestProcessor to administrator role only
- `Line 104`: Form-based authentication configuration with custom login and error pages
- `Line 127`: EJB local references showing the application's component architecture with OrderFulfillmentFacade and Inventory beans
