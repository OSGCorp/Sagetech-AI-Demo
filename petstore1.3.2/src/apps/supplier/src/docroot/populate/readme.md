# Supplier Data Population Scripts Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and showcases J2EE architectural patterns. This sub-project implements database initialization and data population mechanisms along with structured seed data definitions for the supplier component of the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Inventory data initialization for supplier systems
- Structured product quantity definitions
- UTF-8 encoded data support for international product information
- XML-based data schema for inventory records

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML-Based Data Definition: Uses structured XML format with a defined DTD to ensure data integrity and validation
2. Product Inventory Management: Provides initial quantity values (10,000) for all product SKUs in the system
3. Unique Product Identification: Maintains consistent product identification through standardized ID format (EST-x)
4. Supplier-Specific Data Isolation: Separates supplier inventory data from core application data for better modularity

## Overview
The architecture employs a declarative XML approach to define initial data states, ensuring consistency across development and deployment environments. The UTF-8 encoding supports internationalization requirements, while the structured format facilitates automated processing during application initialization. This data population mechanism serves as the foundation for the supplier component's inventory management capabilities, allowing the application to simulate realistic e-commerce scenarios with appropriate stock levels.

## Business Functions

### Data Population
- `Populate-UTF8.xml` : XML data file defining initial inventory quantities for supplier application products.

## Files
### Populate-UTF8.xml

Populate-UTF8.xml is an XML data file that defines the initial inventory quantities for products in the supplier application of the Java Pet Store. It contains a structured list of inventory items, each with a unique product ID (EST-1 through EST-29) and a quantity value (all set to 10,000). The file includes a Document Type Definition (DTD) that specifies the structure of the inventory list, requiring each inventory element to have both an id and quantity attribute. This file likely serves as seed data for populating the supplier's inventory database during application initialization.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 40`: DTD declaration defines strict structure for inventory items requiring both id and quantity attributes
- `Line 49`: All inventory items are initialized with the same quantity (10000), suggesting this is test/sample data
