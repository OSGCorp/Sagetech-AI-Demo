# Supplier PO Processing EJBs Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE platform. The program processes e-commerce transactions and manages inventory for an online pet store. This sub-project implements asynchronous order processing between the main application and supplier systems along with standardized resource lookup mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Message-driven order processing from the Order Processing Center
- Asynchronous supplier communication through JMS messaging
- Standardized JNDI resource naming and lookup
- Order fulfillment and invoice generation

## Identified Design Elements

1. JMS-based Integration: Uses message-driven beans to receive purchase orders from the main application and send back invoices when orders are fulfilled
2. Service Locator Pattern: Centralizes the lookup of enterprise resources through the ServiceLocator utility
3. Facade Pattern: Employs OrderFulfillmentFacade to abstract the complexity of order processing from the message handling logic
4. Standardized JNDI Naming: Maintains consistent resource naming through centralized constants

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes loose coupling through asynchronous messaging, allowing the supplier systems to operate independently from the main application. The message-driven bean architecture provides scalability and reliability in processing purchase orders. The design follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between messaging infrastructure and business logic. The centralized JNDI naming approach ensures consistency between code references and deployment descriptors, facilitating maintenance and configuration changes.

## Business Functions

### Integration Services
- `JNDINames.java` : Constants class defining JNDI names for EJB and JMS resources in the supplier module.
- `SupplierOrderMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that processes purchase orders from OPC, fulfills them, and sends back invoices when orders are shipped.

## Files
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that serves as a central repository for JNDI name constants used in the supplier module of the Java Pet Store application. It defines string constants for JMS resources (topic connection factory and invoice topic) and EJB references (OrderFulfillmentFacade) needed by the purchase order processing components. The class prevents instantiation through a private constructor and provides static final fields that maintain consistency between code references and deployment descriptor configurations. These constants facilitate the lookup of enterprise resources in a standardized way across the supplier application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: Private constructor prevents instantiation, enforcing the class's role as a static utility
- `Line 48-51`: JMS resource JNDI names follow the java:comp/env naming convention for portable resource references
### SupplierOrderMDB.java

SupplierOrderMDB implements a message-driven bean that handles supplier functionality in the Java Pet Store application. It receives purchase orders as JMS messages from the Order Processing Center (OPC), processes them through the OrderFulfillmentFacade, and sends back invoices when orders are shipped. Key methods include onMessage() which processes incoming JMS messages, doWork() which handles the business logic of processing purchase orders, and doTransition() which manages sending invoices back to OPC. The class uses ServiceLocator to obtain references to EJBs and implements the MessageDrivenBean and MessageListener interfaces to function within the J2EE messaging architecture.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: Uses a TransitionDelegate pattern loaded dynamically through JNDI configuration for flexible message routing
- `Line 94`: Implements asynchronous order processing through JMS messaging, decoupling supplier from order processing center
- `Line 106`: Conditional transition handling - only sends invoice if orders were actually shipped
