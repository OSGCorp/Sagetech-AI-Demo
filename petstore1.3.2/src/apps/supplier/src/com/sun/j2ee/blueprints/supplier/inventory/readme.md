# Supplier Inventory Management Subproject Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise-level e-commerce functionality for an online pet store. The program implements a complete shopping experience with catalog browsing, order processing, and backend administration. This sub-project implements supplier inventory tracking and stock management along with automated reordering capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Real-time inventory tracking across multiple suppliers
- Automated stock level monitoring and threshold-based alerts
- Purchase order generation and supplier communication
- Inventory reconciliation and reporting
- Supplier performance analytics

## Identified Design Elements

1. JMS-Based Event Architecture: Uses Java Message Service to decouple inventory changes from order processing, enabling asynchronous updates and system resilience
2. EJB-Powered Business Logic: Leverages stateless session beans to encapsulate supplier communication and inventory management rules
3. XML-Based Supplier Integration: Standardized XML schemas for supplier data exchange with XSLT transformations for different supplier formats
4. Caching Strategy: Implements multi-level caching to optimize inventory queries while maintaining data consistency

## Overview
The architecture follows a service-oriented approach with clear separation between inventory data access, business rules, and supplier communication layers. The system uses JMS topics to broadcast inventory events, allowing multiple components to react appropriately to stock changes. Database interactions are optimized through connection pooling and prepared statements. The supplier integration framework supports both synchronous (HTTP/SOAP) and asynchronous (JMS/file-based) communication methods, with configurable retry policies and error handling for robust operation in production environments.

## Sub-Projects

### src/apps/supplier/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplier/inventory/web

This sub-project implements the supplier inventory management interface along with web-based inventory control capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Web-based inventory management for supplier users
- Purchase order processing and fulfillment
- Inventory quantity tracking and updates
- Integration with EJB-based business components

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation between presentation controllers (RcvrRequestProcessor), data access components (DisplayInventoryBean), and integration services (JNDINames). The web interface connects to backend EJBs through service locators, providing a clean separation between the web tier and business logic. Transaction management is handled within the servlet controllers, which process inventory updates and purchase order fulfillment through appropriate delegate classes.

### src/apps/supplier/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/supplier/inventory/ejb

The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases component-based development using Enterprise JavaBeans. This sub-project implements inventory management functionality through Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) Entity Beans along with their corresponding local interfaces. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Persistent storage of inventory data (item IDs and quantities)
- Inventory level tracking and modification
- Business logic for inventory reduction during order processing
- Data access layer for inventory-related operations

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence: Leverages J2EE container services for automatic persistence of inventory data without explicit database code
2. Local Interface Architecture: Uses the EJB local interface pattern to define contracts for inventory operations
3. Entity Bean Implementation: Follows standard EJB lifecycle patterns with proper implementation of required methods
4. Business Logic Encapsulation: Contains specialized methods like reduceQuantity to handle inventory-specific business rules

#### Overview
The architecture follows the standard EJB component model with clear separation between interfaces and implementation. The InventoryEJB entity bean manages the persistence of inventory items, while the InventoryLocal and InventoryLocalHome interfaces provide the contract for client interaction. This design promotes maintainability through encapsulation of inventory management logic and leverages the container for transaction management and persistence. The component is designed to integrate with the broader supplier subsystem of the Pet Store application.
