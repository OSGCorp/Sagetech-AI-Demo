# Supplier Application Resources Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE 1.3 platform. This sub-project implements XML-based supplier integration resources and transformation capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document type definition (DTD) mapping to XSL stylesheets
- Supplier order processing transformation capabilities
- Integration layer for external supplier systems
- XML schema validation support determination

## Identified Design Elements

1. XML/XSL Transformation Framework: The resource files establish a mapping system between XML document types and their corresponding XSL stylesheets for consistent transformation
2. Namespace-based Processing: The system supports both Sun Microsystems J2EE Blueprints DTDs and HTTP namespaces for flexible document handling
3. Schema Validation Configuration: Boolean flags indicate XSD support status for different document types, enabling appropriate validation strategies
4. Resource-based Integration: Transformation resources are organized in a dedicated supplier resource directory for maintainability

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes standards-based XML processing for supplier integration, providing a flexible transformation framework that can adapt to different supplier document formats. The properties-based configuration approach allows for easy modification of transformation rules without code changes. This integration layer serves as the foundation for the application's supplier order processing capabilities, enabling the Pet Store to communicate effectively with external supplier systems through standardized XML document exchanges.

## Business Functions

### Configuration Files
- `SupplierOrderStyleSheetCatalog.properties` : Configuration file mapping XML DTDs and namespaces to XSL stylesheets for supplier order processing

## Files
### SupplierOrderStyleSheetCatalog.properties

This properties file defines mappings between XML document type definitions (DTDs) and their corresponding XSL stylesheets for supplier order processing. It maps both Sun Microsystems J2EE Blueprints DTDs and HTTP namespaces to specific XSL transformation files located in the supplier resource directory. The file also includes boolean flags indicating XSD support status for each document type, which helps the application determine how to process different types of supplier orders.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-2`: Maps Sun Microsystems DTD identifiers to specific XSL stylesheet paths with escaped spaces in the identifiers
- `Line 4-5`: Maps HTTP namespace URLs to XSL stylesheets with explicit XSD support flags
