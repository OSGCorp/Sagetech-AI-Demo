# Inventory Management EJBs Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture patterns and best practices using the J2EE platform. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases component-based development using Enterprise JavaBeans. This sub-project implements inventory management functionality through Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) Entity Beans along with their corresponding local interfaces. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Persistent storage of inventory data (item IDs and quantities)
- Inventory level tracking and modification
- Business logic for inventory reduction during order processing
- Data access layer for inventory-related operations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Container-Managed Persistence: Leverages J2EE container services for automatic persistence of inventory data without explicit database code
2. Local Interface Architecture: Uses the EJB local interface pattern to define contracts for inventory operations
3. Entity Bean Implementation: Follows standard EJB lifecycle patterns with proper implementation of required methods
4. Business Logic Encapsulation: Contains specialized methods like reduceQuantity to handle inventory-specific business rules

## Overview
The architecture follows the standard EJB component model with clear separation between interfaces and implementation. The InventoryEJB entity bean manages the persistence of inventory items, while the InventoryLocal and InventoryLocalHome interfaces provide the contract for client interaction. This design promotes maintainability through encapsulation of inventory management logic and leverages the container for transaction management and persistence. The component is designed to integrate with the broader supplier subsystem of the Pet Store application.

## Business Functions

### Inventory Management
- `InventoryLocal.java` : Local interface for the Inventory EJB component defining inventory management operations.
- `InventoryEJB.java` : Entity bean implementation for inventory management in the supplier module of Java Pet Store.
- `InventoryLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for the Inventory EJB component in the supplier application.

## Files
### InventoryEJB.java

InventoryEJB implements an Entity Bean that manages inventory items in the supplier application. It provides container-managed persistence for inventory items with itemId and quantity fields. The class offers methods to access and modify these fields, including a specialized reduceQuantity method to decrease inventory levels. The bean implements standard EJB lifecycle methods required by the EntityBean interface, including ejbCreate for initializing new inventory items, and context management methods. There is also a commented-out addQuantity method that would increase inventory levels.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: The reduceQuantity method demonstrates business logic implementation within an entity bean
- `Line 85`: The addQuantity method is commented out but shows how the component was designed for bidirectional inventory adjustments
- `Line 99`: The ejbCreate method shows the initialization pattern for container-managed persistence fields
### InventoryLocal.java

InventoryLocal defines the local interface for the Inventory CMP (Container-Managed Persistence) Bean in the supplier application. It extends EJBLocalObject and specifies methods for inventory management operations. The interface provides getter methods for retrieving item ID and quantity, a setter for updating quantity, and a business method for reducing inventory quantities. There's also a commented-out addQuantity method that is currently unused. This interface serves as the contract for local clients to interact with the inventory management functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Interface extends EJBLocalObject, making it a local EJB component interface in the J2EE architecture
- `Line 55`: Contains commented code indicating functionality that was implemented but later disabled
### InventoryLocalHome.java

InventoryLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the Inventory CMP Bean in the supplier application. It extends EJBLocalHome and provides methods for creating and finding inventory items. The interface includes a create method that takes an itemId and quantity parameter, and two finder methods: findByPrimaryKey to locate inventory by itemId and findAllInventoryItems to retrieve all inventory items. This interface is part of the EJB component architecture for managing inventory in the supplier subsystem.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: Follows the EJB 2.0 pattern for local interfaces, which provides more efficient access than remote interfaces for components deployed in the same container
