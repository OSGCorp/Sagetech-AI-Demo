# OPC Web Application Configuration Of Java Pet Store

The OPC Web Application Configuration is a Java-based component that serves as the web interface for the Order Processing Center within the Java Pet Store application. This subproject implements the servlet configuration and web deployment specifications for the OPC module, providing a structured interface between the web tier and the business logic of the order processing functionality. The configuration establishes the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses within the J2EE architecture of the Pet Store application.

This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Web-based access to order processing functionality
- Servlet mapping and request handling for order-related operations
- Integration point between web tier and business logic components
- Deployment configuration for the OPC web application container

## Identified Design Elements

1. Servlet 2.3 Specification Compliance: The configuration adheres to the J2EE Servlet 2.3 specification, ensuring compatibility with standard application servers
2. Minimal Configuration Approach: Employs a streamlined deployment descriptor that focuses on essential configuration elements
3. Component Isolation: Maintains the OPC as a distinct deployable unit (WAR) within the larger Pet Store architecture
4. Standardized Naming Conventions: Uses consistent naming patterns that align with the overall Java Pet Store application structure

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between presentation and business logic. The web.xml deployment descriptor provides the foundation for servlet container configuration while maintaining a modular design that allows the OPC component to be deployed and managed independently. This approach supports maintainability and allows for focused development of order processing functionality without impacting other areas of the application.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `web.xml` : Web application deployment descriptor for the Order Processing Center (OPC) application.

## Files
### web.xml

This web.xml file serves as the deployment descriptor for the Order Processing Center (OPC) web application component of Java Pet Store. It defines the basic configuration for the web application following the Servlet 2.3 specification. The file contains minimal configuration, only specifying the display name 'OrderProcessingCenterWAR' and a brief description identifying it as the Web Tier deployment descriptor for the OPC application. The document includes Sun Microsystems' copyright notice and redistribution terms.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 44`: Uses the Servlet 2.3 DTD specification, indicating this is designed for J2EE 1.3 compatible application servers
