# OPC XML Schema Definitions Of Java Pet Store

The OPC XML Schema Definitions is a Java-based component that provides XML validation capabilities for the Order Processing Center (OPC) within the Java Pet Store application. This sub-project implements schema definitions and entity mappings for standardized document formats used in order processing, along with the infrastructure to validate XML data against these schemas. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document validation for order processing transactions
- Schema-to-file resolution through entity catalog mappings
- Support for both DTD and XSD validation formats
- Standardized document type definitions for business transactions

## Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Resolution System: Maps logical XML schema identifiers to physical file locations using the EntityCatalog.properties configuration
2. Multi-format Schema Support: Handles both traditional DTD format and modern XSD schema definitions
3. Transaction Document Standardization: Defines formal structures for key business documents (LineItem, SupplierOrder, Invoice)
4. Integration Layer Architecture: Positions the validation component as a bridge between the application and external systems

## Overview
The architecture follows XML standards best practices by separating document type definitions from implementation logic. The EntityCatalog provides a flexible resolution mechanism that allows schema locations to be modified without changing application code. The schema definitions establish a contract for data exchange between the Pet Store application and its order processing components, ensuring data integrity through formal validation. This approach enables reliable integration with supplier systems while maintaining a consistent document structure throughout the order lifecycle.

## Business Functions

### Configuration Files
- `EntityCatalog.properties` : XML schema mapping configuration file for Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) document types

## Files
### EntityCatalog.properties

EntityCatalog.properties is a configuration file that maps XML DTD and schema identifiers to their physical file locations within the application. It defines mappings for TPA-LineItem, TPA-SupplierOrder, and TPA-Invoice document types, both for DTD format (using public identifiers) and XSD format (using HTTP URLs). These mappings enable XML parsers to locate the correct schema definitions when validating XML documents in the Java Pet Store application's order processing component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-3`: Maps DTD public identifiers to local file paths using Sun Microsystems J2EE Blueprints Group namespace
- `Line 4-6`: Maps HTTP URLs to local XSD schema files using blueprints.j2ee.sun.com domain
