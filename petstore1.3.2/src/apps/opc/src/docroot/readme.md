# OPC Web Root Directory Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and showcases J2EE architectural patterns. This sub-project implements the web interface for the Order Processing Center (OPC) along with static resources necessary for the front-end functionality. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Static resource management for web presentation layer
- HTML templates and UI components for order processing
- CSS and JavaScript assets for responsive design
- Image resources for product catalog and UI elements

## Identified Design Elements

1. MVC Architecture: Clear separation between model (order data), view (JSP templates), and controller (servlets) components
2. Resource Organization: Structured directory hierarchy for efficient management of static assets
3. Internationalization Support: Resources organized to facilitate multiple language implementations
4. Responsive Design: CSS and JavaScript components that adapt to different screen sizes and devices

## Overview
The OPC Web Root Directory serves as the presentation layer for the Order Processing Center within the Java Pet Store application. It follows J2EE best practices with a clean separation between business logic and presentation. The static resources are organized to optimize loading times and maintainability, while the templating system allows for consistent branding across the application. The directory structure reflects the functional areas of the order processing workflow, with dedicated resources for order entry, confirmation, and status tracking. This component integrates with the broader Pet Store application through well-defined interfaces, making it suitable for enhancement with minimal impact on other system components.

## Sub-Projects

### src/apps/opc/src/docroot/schemas

This sub-project implements schema definitions and entity mappings for standardized document formats used in order processing, along with the infrastructure to validate XML data against these schemas. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML document validation for order processing transactions
- Schema-to-file resolution through entity catalog mappings
- Support for both DTD and XSD validation formats
- Standardized document type definitions for business transactions

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Entity Resolution System: Maps logical XML schema identifiers to physical file locations using the EntityCatalog.properties configuration
2. Multi-format Schema Support: Handles both traditional DTD format and modern XSD schema definitions
3. Transaction Document Standardization: Defines formal structures for key business documents (LineItem, SupplierOrder, Invoice)
4. Integration Layer Architecture: Positions the validation component as a bridge between the application and external systems

#### Overview
The architecture follows XML standards best practices by separating document type definitions from implementation logic. The EntityCatalog provides a flexible resolution mechanism that allows schema locations to be modified without changing application code. The schema definitions establish a contract for data exchange between the Pet Store application and its order processing components, ensuring data integrity through formal validation. This approach enables reliable integration with supplier systems while maintaining a consistent document structure throughout the order lifecycle.

### src/apps/opc/src/docroot/WEB-INF

This subproject implements the servlet configuration and web deployment specifications for the OPC module, providing a structured interface between the web tier and the business logic of the order processing functionality. The configuration establishes the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses within the J2EE architecture of the Pet Store application.

This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Web-based access to order processing functionality
- Servlet mapping and request handling for order-related operations
- Integration point between web tier and business logic components
- Deployment configuration for the OPC web application container

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Servlet 2.3 Specification Compliance: The configuration adheres to the J2EE Servlet 2.3 specification, ensuring compatibility with standard application servers
2. Minimal Configuration Approach: Employs a streamlined deployment descriptor that focuses on essential configuration elements
3. Component Isolation: Maintains the OPC as a distinct deployable unit (WAR) within the larger Pet Store architecture
4. Standardized Naming Conventions: Uses consistent naming patterns that align with the overall Java Pet Store application structure

#### Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between presentation and business logic. The web.xml deployment descriptor provides the foundation for servlet container configuration while maintaining a modular design that allows the OPC component to be deployed and managed independently. This approach supports maintainability and allows for focused development of order processing functionality without impacting other areas of the application.
