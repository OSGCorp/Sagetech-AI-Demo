# Customer Relations EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE platform. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases integration of various J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements customer communication components along with order notification services through message-driven beans. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Automated customer email notifications for order events
- JMS message processing for order workflow
- XML-based content transformation for email formatting
- Internationalization support for customer communications

## Identified Design Elements

1. Message-Driven Architecture: Uses JMS and MDBs to process asynchronous order events and generate appropriate customer communications
2. XML Document Processing: Leverages XSL transformations to convert order data into formatted HTML email content
3. Internationalization Support: Implements locale-specific formatting and content generation for global customer base
4. Service Locator Pattern: Centralizes access to EJB references and configuration settings through JNDI

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes a message-driven approach to customer communications, with three specialized MDBs handling different order lifecycle events (approval, invoicing, completion). XML processing is centralized through the MailContentXDE component, which manages transformations and caching. The system is designed for internationalization with LocaleUtil providing locale parsing capabilities. Configuration is simplified through the JNDINames class that centralizes service lookup constants. This modular design allows for easy extension of customer communication channels and formats while maintaining a consistent notification workflow.

## Business Functions

### Email Notification Services
- `MailCompletedOrderMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that emails customers when their orders are completely shipped
- `MailInvoiceMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that emails order invoices to customers after shipment.
- `MailOrderApprovalMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that processes order approval messages and sends email notifications to customers.

### XML Processing
- `MailContentXDE.java` : Formats email content by applying XSL transformations to XML documents with locale support.

### Internationalization Utilities
- `LocaleUtil.java` : Utility class for converting locale strings to Locale objects in the OPC customer relations module.

### Configuration
- `JNDINames.java` : Constants class defining JNDI names for EJB references and environment variables in the OPC customer relations module.

## Files
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that centralizes JNDI name constants used throughout the OPC customer relations module. It defines string constants for EJB references and environment variables needed for the application's operation. The class includes JNDI names for the PurchaseOrder EJB and various email notification settings (order confirmation, approval, and completion emails). It also defines constants for XML validation parameters including invoice validation, order approval validation, XSD validation, and entity catalog URL. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it's designed to be used statically.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: Private constructor prevents instantiation of this utility class, enforcing its use as a static constants container only.
- `Line 60-76`: Email notification configuration parameters are defined as environment variables, allowing deployment-time configuration of notification behavior.
### LocaleUtil.java

LocaleUtil provides a utility method for converting string representations of locales into Java Locale objects within the OPC customer relations module. The class implements a single static method, getLocaleFromString(), which parses locale strings formatted with language, country, and optional variant components separated by underscores. The method handles special cases like null inputs and 'default' locale strings, returning appropriate Locale objects or null when parsing fails. This utility supports internationalization features in the Java Pet Store application by facilitating locale-based customization.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: The method parses locale strings with a specific format (language_country_variant) using string manipulation rather than built-in locale parsing methods.
- `Line 48`: Special handling for 'default' string returns the system's default locale rather than parsing it as a locale string.
### MailCompletedOrderMDB.java

MailCompletedOrderMDB implements a message-driven bean that processes JMS messages containing completed order information. It generates and sends email notifications to customers when their orders are fully shipped. The class retrieves order details, formats them using XSL transformation, creates mail messages, and sends them through a mailer service. Key functionality includes message processing, email content generation, and transition handling. Important components include the onMessage() method for processing incoming messages, doWork() for generating email content, and doTransition() for sending emails. The class uses ServiceLocator to access configuration and EJB references.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 116`: Uses XSL transformation to format order data into customer-friendly email content
- `Line 91`: Implements conditional email sending based on configuration parameter retrieved from ServiceLocator
- `Line 157`: Leverages TransitionDelegate pattern to decouple message sending from the core business logic
### MailContentXDE.java

MailContentXDE extends XMLDocumentEditor.DefaultXDE to format email content by applying XSL stylesheets to XML documents. It manages transformers for different locales, caches them for reuse, and provides methods to set XML source documents and retrieve formatted output. The class includes a nested FormatterException for error handling with root cause tracking. Key functionality includes locale-specific stylesheet selection, XML transformation, and output encoding management. Important methods include getTransformer(), setDocument(), getDocument(), getDocumentAsString(), and format(). The class uses TransformerFactory to create XSLT processors and maintains a HashMap of transformers keyed by locale.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 91`: Implements recursive root cause exception tracking pattern for better error diagnosis
- `Line 137`: Uses locale-based resource path construction for internationalized XSL stylesheets
- `Line 187`: Lazy initialization pattern for transformation results improves performance
### MailInvoiceMDB.java

MailInvoiceMDB implements a message-driven bean that processes JMS messages containing invoice information for shipped orders. It transforms the invoice XML into a formatted HTML email and sends it to customers. Key functionality includes parsing invoice XML documents, retrieving purchase order details, formatting email content using XSL stylesheets, and sending the email through a mail service. Important components include the onMessage() method for JMS message handling, doWork() for email content generation, and doTransition() for email delivery. The class uses TransitionDelegate for workflow management and various XDE classes for XML document processing.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 89`: Uses service locator pattern to obtain configuration values and EJB references
- `Line 113`: Implements JMS MessageListener interface to receive asynchronous invoice notifications
- `Line 149`: Transforms XML invoice into HTML email using XSL stylesheet
- `Line 166`: Uses transition delegate pattern to handle workflow progression
### MailOrderApprovalMDB.java

MailOrderApprovalMDB implements a message-driven bean that processes JMS messages containing OrderApproval XML documents. It extracts order information, formats email content using XSL transformation, and sends notification emails to customers about their order status. Key functionality includes parsing XML messages, retrieving purchase order details, generating HTML email content, and forwarding mail messages to a mailer service. Important methods include onMessage(), doWork(), and doTransition(). The class uses ServiceLocator to retrieve configuration settings and dependencies like PurchaseOrderLocalHome.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 118`: Uses XML Document Exchange (XDE) pattern with XSL transformation to convert order data into HTML email content
- `Line 151`: Implements conditional email sending based on configuration parameter 'sendConfirmationMail'
- `Line 168`: Uses TransitionDelegate pattern to decouple message processing from delivery mechanism
- `Line 186`: Processes collections of order approvals in a single message, generating multiple emails
