# Order Processing Center Core of Java Pet Store

The Order Processing Center Core is a Java-based component that manages the complete order fulfillment process within the Java Pet Store application. The system processes customer orders from submission through completion, handling customer notifications, order status management, and administrative oversight. This sub-project implements a robust messaging architecture along with comprehensive administrative capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Order lifecycle management through EJB-based processing
- Customer notification system via email for various order stages
- Administrative interface for order monitoring and reporting
- XML-based document processing with XSL transformations

## Identified Design Elements

1. Message-Driven Architecture: Utilizes JMS and message-driven beans (MDBs) to process order events asynchronously at different stages of the fulfillment pipeline
2. XML Document Processing: Implements XML document editing and transformation for generating customer communications from order data
3. Internationalization Support: Provides locale-specific formatting and communication through the LocaleUtil class and locale-aware transformers
4. Facade Pattern Implementation: Exposes administrative functionality through a clean facade interface that abstracts underlying complexity

## Overview
The architecture follows a service-oriented approach with clear separation between customer relations and administrative components. The customer relations module handles notifications through specialized MDBs that process order events, transform XML data using XSL stylesheets, and deliver emails to customers. The administrative module provides monitoring and reporting capabilities through a facade pattern that abstracts data access operations. The system emphasizes maintainability through centralized JNDI naming, reusable transfer objects, and standardized exception handling, while supporting both programmatic and user interfaces for order management.
