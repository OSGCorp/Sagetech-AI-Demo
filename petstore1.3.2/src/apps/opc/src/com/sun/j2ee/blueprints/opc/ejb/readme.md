# OPC Core EJB Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality through a comprehensive order processing system. The program implements asynchronous message-driven workflows and XML-based document processing for order management. This sub-project implements the core Enterprise JavaBeans that handle order processing, approval workflows, and invoice management. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Asynchronous message processing through JMS-based workflows
- Order approval and fulfillment automation
- XML document processing for business transactions
- Stateful order lifecycle management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Message-Driven Architecture**: Three primary MDBs (PurchaseOrderMDB, OrderApprovalMDB, InvoiceMDB) form a complete order processing pipeline that communicates via JMS queues
2. **Workflow State Management**: ProcessManager EJB handles state transitions for orders as they move through the fulfillment process
3. **XML Document Processing**: Specialized XML Document Editors (XDEs) parse and validate business documents against schemas
4. **Delegation Pattern**: TransitionDelegate pattern separates business logic from messaging concerns
5. **Automatic Order Approval Logic**: Built-in business rules determine which orders require manual approval based on amount thresholds

## Overview
The architecture follows a message-driven design that enables asynchronous processing of orders through distinct stages. Purchase orders originate from the storefront, are validated and approved (automatically or manually depending on value), processed for fulfillment, and completed upon invoice receipt. The system maintains centralized JNDI naming conventions through the JNDINames utility class, ensuring consistent service lookups across components. XML document processing provides standardized data exchange with external systems like supplier networks and financial services.

## Business Functions

### Order Processing
- `OrderApprovalMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that processes order approval messages, updates order status, and sends supplier purchase orders.
- `PurchaseOrderMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that processes purchase orders from Java Pet Store by creating PurchaseOrder EJBs and handling order approval workflow.

### Invoice Management
- `InvoiceMDB.java` : Message-driven bean that processes invoice messages and updates purchase order status in the Java Pet Store application.
- `TPAInvoiceXDE.java` : XML document editor for TPA invoices that parses and extracts order and line item data.

### System Configuration
- `JNDINames.java` : Constants class defining JNDI names for EJBs and XML validation parameters in the Order Processing Center component.

## Files
### InvoiceMDB.java

InvoiceMDB implements a message-driven bean that processes JMS messages containing invoice information for customer orders. It updates purchase order status based on shipped items and manages order completion workflow. Key functionality includes extracting invoice data from XML messages, updating purchase orders through the PurchaseOrderLocal interface, and triggering transitions when orders are complete. The class uses ServiceLocator to obtain EJB references and XML validation services. Important methods include onMessage(), doWork(), and doTransition(), with supporting components like TPAInvoiceXDE for XML processing and TransitionDelegate for workflow management.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 119`: Uses a service locator pattern to obtain EJB references and configuration parameters
- `Line 134`: Implements JMS message handling to process XML invoices in an asynchronous manner
- `Line 175`: Implements a workflow state transition system for order processing completion
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames implements a utility class that serves as a central repository for JNDI names used in the Order Processing Center (OPC) component. It defines static final String constants for EJB references (ProcessManager and PurchaseOrder) and XML validation parameters for various document types (PurchaseOrder, Invoice, OrderApproval). The class also includes constants for XML validation configuration, entity catalog URL, and transition delegate references. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it's designed to be used statically. These JNDI names must be synchronized with the deployment descriptors to ensure proper component lookup.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Private constructor prevents instantiation of this utility class
- `Line 49-71`: Constants follow a consistent naming pattern with java:comp/env prefix, indicating they're environment entries in the JNDI context
### OrderApprovalMDB.java

OrderApprovalMDB implements a message-driven bean that processes JMS messages containing order approval status updates. It receives order approval XML messages, updates the purchase order status in the database, generates supplier purchase orders for approved orders, and prepares notifications for customer relations. The class uses a transition delegate pattern to handle the actual sending of messages to suppliers and customer relations. Key methods include onMessage() which processes incoming JMS messages, doWork() which handles the business logic of processing approvals, and doTransition() which delegates the sending of messages. Important variables include processManager for updating order status, transitionDelegate for handling transitions, and supplierOrderXDE for XML document handling.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 90`: Uses an inner class WorkResult to bundle multiple return values from the doWork method
- `Line 152`: Implements JMS message handling with state validation before processing order approvals
- `Line 197`: Uses a transition delegate pattern to abstract the actual sending of messages
- `Line 221`: Converts internal purchase order data to supplier-specific XML format
### PurchaseOrderMDB.java

PurchaseOrderMDB implements a message-driven bean that receives JMS messages containing purchase orders from Java Pet Store customers. It creates PurchaseOrder EJBs to begin order fulfillment and manages the workflow process. For small orders (under $500 for US or Â¥50000 for Japan), it automatically approves them and forwards to OrderApproval queue, while larger orders await administrator approval. Key methods include onMessage() which processes incoming JMS messages, doWork() which creates purchase orders and initiates workflow, and doTransition() which handles order approval transitions. The class uses ServiceLocator to obtain references to EJB homes and interacts with the ProcessManager for workflow management.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 124`: Implements automatic order approval logic based on order total and locale
- `Line 94`: Uses TransitionDelegate pattern to handle workflow transitions between system components
- `Line 83`: Leverages ServiceLocator pattern to obtain EJB references and configuration parameters
### TPAInvoiceXDE.java

TPAInvoiceXDE implements an XML document editor for TPA invoices, extending XMLDocumentEditor.DefaultXDE. It parses invoice XML documents to extract order IDs and line item quantities. The class provides methods to set and retrieve documents from various sources, validate against DTD or XSD schemas, and access the extracted order data. Key functionality includes XML parsing, data extraction, and document transformation. Important constants define XML namespaces and element names, while key methods include setDocument(), getOrderId(), getLineItemIds(), and extractData(). The class maintains state through orderId, lineItemIds, and invoiceDocument variables.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 82`: Uses a transformer to deserialize XML from various sources with configurable validation options
- `Line 106`: Extracts structured data from XML document using namespace-aware parsing methods
- `Line 125`: Contains a main() method allowing the class to be used as a standalone invoice parser
