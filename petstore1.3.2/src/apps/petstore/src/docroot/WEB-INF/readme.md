# Pet Store Web Application Configuration Of Java Pet Store

The Pet Store Web Application Configuration is a Java-based web application framework that provides the presentation and controller layers for the Java Pet Store e-commerce platform. The configuration implements a sophisticated MVC architecture with template-based views, event-driven controllers, and multi-language support. This subproject provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Configurable screen layouts with consistent templating
- Internationalization support for multiple languages (English, Chinese, Japanese)
- Security constraints and authentication flow management
- Event-to-action and URL-to-action mappings for controller logic
- Servlet configuration and resource references

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Template-Based View System**: The screen definition files establish a consistent layout structure while allowing for localized content across different functional areas of the application.
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Separate screen definition files for different locales (en_US, zh_CN, ja_JP) enable internationalized user interfaces with language-specific JSP components.
3. **Security Framework**: The signon-config.xml implements resource protection through URL pattern constraints and authentication requirements.
4. **Controller Mapping System**: The mappings.xml creates a sophisticated routing system connecting frontend events to backend EJB actions and handling exceptions with appropriate error screens.
5. **Resource Configuration**: The web.xml establishes connections to EJBs, configures filters for encoding and authentication, and sets up the Fast Lane Reader pattern for direct database access.

## Overview
The architecture implements a robust MVC pattern with clear separation between presentation and business logic. The template-based view system promotes consistency while supporting multiple languages. The controller framework uses event mappings to connect user actions with appropriate backend services. Security is implemented through declarative constraints that protect sensitive resources. The configuration emphasizes maintainability through structured screen definitions and centralized mapping configurations, while supporting both traditional web interfaces and programmatic access patterns.

## Business Functions

### Authentication and Security
- `signon-config.xml` : Configuration file defining sign-on security constraints for the Java Pet Store application.

### Application Flow Control
- `mappings.xml` : XML configuration file mapping events and URLs to controller actions in the Java Pet Store application.

### Internationalization and Localization
- `screendefinitions_zh_CN.xml` : Chinese (Simplified) screen definitions XML file for Java Pet Store web application UI layout.
- `screendefinitions_ja_JP.xml` : Japanese localization screen definitions for the Pet Store web application.
- `screendefinitions_en_US.xml` : XML configuration file defining screen layouts and components for the Java Pet Store web application.

### Web Application Configuration
- `web.xml` : Web application deployment descriptor for Java Pet Store, defining servlets, filters, and EJB references.

## Files
### mappings.xml

This mappings.xml file defines the event-to-action and URL-to-action mappings for the Java Pet Store application's controller framework. It establishes connections between frontend events and their corresponding EJB actions through event-mapping elements, linking classes like OrderEvent to OrderEJBAction. It also configures URL mappings that associate web requests with HTML actions and screen destinations, some using flow handlers for complex navigation. Additionally, it defines exception mappings that direct specific error types to appropriate error screens, creating a comprehensive routing configuration for the MVC architecture.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45-79`: Implements event-to-EJB action mappings that connect frontend events to backend business logic
- `Line 81-115`: Defines URL mappings with optional flow handlers for complex navigation paths
- `Line 117-119`: Maps exceptions to specific error screens for graceful error handling
### screendefinitions_en_US.xml

This XML configuration file defines the screen layouts for the Java Pet Store web application's user interface. It establishes a default template and defines 20 different screens including main, cart, category, product, item, customer, search, and various account-related screens. Each screen definition specifies parameters for page components like title, banner, sidebar, body content, footer, and other UI elements. The file organizes the application's presentation layer by mapping logical screen names to their corresponding JSP components, creating a consistent layout structure throughout the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses XML to implement a template-based UI composition pattern, separating screen structure from content
- `Line 42`: Defines a default template that serves as the base for all screens in the application
- `Line 44-51`: Each screen definition uses parameters to compose UI components, enabling modular page construction
### screendefinitions_ja_JP.xml

This XML file defines screen layouts for the Japanese version of the Pet Store application. It specifies a default template and defines multiple screens (main, cart, product, etc.) with their respective parameters. Each screen definition includes components like title, banner, sidebar, body content, and footer, all pointing to Japanese-localized JSP files. The file enables consistent page structure across the application while maintaining Japanese language support through the _ja_JP suffix and /ja/ directory paths.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Copyright notice indicates this is Sun Microsystems code with specific redistribution terms
- `Line 45`: Default template path shows localization structure with /ja/ directory
- `Line 47-54`: Main screen definition demonstrates the template composition pattern with multiple content fragments
### screendefinitions_zh_CN.xml

This XML file defines screen layouts for the Chinese (Simplified) localization of the Java Pet Store application. It specifies a default template and defines multiple screens (main, cart, product, etc.) with parameters for various UI components. Each screen definition includes parameters for title, banner, sidebar, body content, footer, and other page elements, all pointing to localized JSP files in the /zh/ directory. The file ensures consistent page structure while providing Chinese language content across the application's different functional areas.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Copyright notice indicates this is Sun Microsystems code with specific redistribution terms
- `Line 44`: Default template path shows localization structure with /zh/ directory for Chinese content
- `Line 47-54`: Screen definitions use a combination of localized components (/zh/) and shared components (like main.jsp)
### signon-config.xml

This XML configuration file defines the authentication and authorization settings for the Java Pet Store application. It specifies the sign-on form login page and error page to be used when authentication fails. The file also declares several security constraints that protect specific web resources, including customer screens, customer actions, order information screens, and the sign-on welcome screen. Each constraint identifies protected URL patterns that require user authentication before access is granted.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39-42`: Defines the main login page and error page paths for the application's authentication system
- `Line 45-51`: Implements security constraint for customer profile screen, requiring authentication
- `Line 54-60`: Protects customer action endpoints that handle form submissions and data modifications
### web.xml

This web.xml deployment descriptor configures the Java Pet Store web application. It defines essential web components including EncodingFilter for UTF-8 encoding, SignOnFilter for authentication, and key servlets like MainServlet (front controller) and TemplateServlet for view rendering. The file configures servlet mappings (.do and .screen extensions), session timeout settings, and welcome files. It establishes numerous EJB local references for components like ShoppingController, ShoppingCart, and Customer entities. The descriptor also configures resources for the Fast Lane Reader pattern to access catalog data directly via JDBC, and defines environment entries for component configuration including the database type (Cloudscape).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Implements UTF-8 encoding filter to ensure proper character handling across the application
- `Line 127`: Enables Fast Lane Reader pattern for direct JDBC database access from web tier, bypassing EJB layer for read operations
- `Line 166`: Configures component manager and web controller through environment entries rather than hard-coding
- `Line 173`: Establishes local EJB references using ejb-link to connect web tier with business logic components
