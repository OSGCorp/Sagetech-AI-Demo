# Subproject Pet Store Exception Handlers Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture using J2EE technologies. The program implements e-commerce functionality and showcases best practices for scalable web applications. This sub-project implements exception handling mechanisms for the controller layer along with specialized error types for business logic validation. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific error conditions
- Serializable exception classes for proper error state propagation
- Consistent error messaging patterns across the application
- Business rule validation through specialized exceptions

## Identified Design Elements

1. Exception Inheritance Structure: All custom exceptions extend from EventException, providing a consistent base for error handling throughout the application
2. Serialization Support: Exceptions implement Serializable to ensure proper state preservation across distributed components
3. Descriptive Error Messages: Each exception type encapsulates specific error context with appropriate messaging
4. Business Logic Validation: Exceptions represent specific business rule violations (e.g., duplicate accounts, empty cart orders)

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between technical and business exceptions, with specialized types for common error conditions in the e-commerce flow. The exception handlers provide meaningful feedback for both user interface and system-level error reporting. This design supports robust error handling for critical user operations like account creation and order processing, enhancing both system reliability and user experience by providing clear, actionable error information.

## Business Functions

### Account Management Exceptions
- `DuplicateAccountException.java` : Custom exception class for handling duplicate user account scenarios in the Pet Store application.

### Shopping Cart Exceptions
- `ShoppingCartEmptyOrderException.java` : Custom exception for empty shopping cart order attempts in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### DuplicateAccountException.java

DuplicateAccountException implements a serializable exception class that extends EventException to handle cases where a user attempts to create an account that already exists. The class stores an error message provided during instantiation and provides a getMessage() method to retrieve this message. This exception is part of the controller exception hierarchy in the Pet Store application and is used specifically for user account creation failures due to duplicates.
### ShoppingCartEmptyOrderException.java

ShoppingCartEmptyOrderException implements a custom exception that extends EventException and implements Serializable. It represents a failure to place an order when the shopping cart is empty, typically occurring when users hit the back button and attempt to resubmit an order. The class maintains a message string that describes the exception and provides a getMessage() method to retrieve this information. This exception is part of the controller exception handling framework in the Pet Store application.
