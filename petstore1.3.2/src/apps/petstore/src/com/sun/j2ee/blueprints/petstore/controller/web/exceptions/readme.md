# Pet Store Web Exception Handlers Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and showcases best practices for J2EE development. This sub-project implements specialized exception handling for web interactions along with form validation error management. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Custom exception types for web-specific error scenarios
- Form validation error tracking and reporting
- Structured error information for both user interface and programmatic handling
- Integration with the application's exception handling framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. Form Validation Framework: The exception handlers work with the RequestToEventTranslator to validate user input and report specific missing or invalid fields
2. Layered Exception Hierarchy: Exceptions extend from HTMLActionException to maintain consistent error handling patterns
3. Detailed Error Reporting: Exceptions store both general error messages and specific field-level validation failures
4. JSP Integration: Exception data is structured to be easily consumable by JSP pages for user-friendly error presentation

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between business logic and presentation-layer error handling. The MissingFormDataException specifically tracks form field validation failures, enabling precise error reporting to users. This approach allows the application to maintain state during form submission errors, preserving valid data while highlighting only problematic fields. The exception handlers integrate with both the web presentation layer and the underlying business logic, ensuring consistent error management throughout the application flow.

## Business Functions

### Form Validation Exceptions
- `MissingFormDataException.java` : Custom exception for handling missing form data in the Java Pet Store web controller.

## Files
### MissingFormDataException.java

MissingFormDataException implements a custom exception that extends HTMLActionException to handle cases where users fail to provide required form information. The class stores both an error message and a collection of missing form fields. It provides methods to retrieve these values through getMissingFields() and getMessage(). This exception is thrown by the RequestToEventTranslator and used by JSP pages to generate appropriate error messages when form validation fails.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Implements Serializable to allow the exception to be passed between different JVMs or persisted
