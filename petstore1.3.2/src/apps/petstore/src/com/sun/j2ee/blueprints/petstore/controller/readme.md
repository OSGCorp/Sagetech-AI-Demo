# Pet Store Controller Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program handles online pet shopping workflows and showcases best practices for building scalable enterprise applications. This sub-project implements the MVC controller layer that coordinates user interactions along with view rendering capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request handling and routing for all user interactions
- View templating with dual-format support (HTML and JSON)
- Form validation and data binding
- Component-based UI architecture with reusable widgets

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/apps/petstore/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/petstore/controller/web

The Pet Store Web Controller sub-project implements the web-tier controller components that handle HTTP requests and manage the presentation layer interaction with the underlying business logic. This controller framework bridges the gap between the user interface and the EJB tier, providing a structured approach to request handling and response generation.

The sub-project delivers these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request routing and event handling for shopping and user management operations
- Session management and authentication through sign-on notification
- Component-based architecture with clear separation between web and EJB tiers
- Dynamic content generation with support for multiple output formats
- Flow control for multi-step user interactions like account creation

### src/apps/petstore/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/petstore/controller/exceptions

The program implements e-commerce functionality and showcases best practices for scalable web applications. This sub-project implements exception handling mechanisms for the controller layer along with specialized error types for business logic validation. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific error conditions
- Serializable exception classes for proper error state propagation
- Consistent error messaging patterns across the application
- Business rule validation through specialized exceptions

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Exception Inheritance Structure: All custom exceptions extend from EventException, providing a consistent base for error handling throughout the application
2. Serialization Support: Exceptions implement Serializable to ensure proper state preservation across distributed components
3. Descriptive Error Messages: Each exception type encapsulates specific error context with appropriate messaging
4. Business Logic Validation: Exceptions represent specific business rule violations (e.g., duplicate accounts, empty cart orders)

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between technical and business exceptions, with specialized types for common error conditions in the e-commerce flow. The exception handlers provide meaningful feedback for both user interface and system-level error reporting. This design supports robust error handling for critical user operations like account creation and order processing, enhancing both system reliability and user experience by providing clear, actionable error information.

### src/apps/petstore/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/petstore/controller/events

This sub-project implements a robust event-driven architecture along with standardized response handling mechanisms. The system provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Encapsulated event objects for various business operations (user creation, cart management, orders)
- Standardized event handling patterns through EventSupport extension
- Clean separation between event generation and processing
- Type-safe data transfer between application layers

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Event Type Identification: Each event class implements getEventName() to provide JNDI-compatible identifiers for event routing
2. Immutable Event Pattern: Events store all required data at creation time with getter-only access
3. Action Type Flags: Events like CartEvent use enumerated action types to specify the intended operation
4. Defensive Copying: Collection-based events implement defensive copying to prevent external modification
5. Hierarchical Event Structure: All events extend from a common EventSupport base class

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns by encapsulating business operations as discrete events. The system supports user management (CreateUserEvent, SignOnEvent), shopping operations (CartEvent), and order processing (OrderEvent, OrderEventResponse). Each event type contains precisely the data needed for its specific operation, promoting loose coupling between components. The consistent implementation pattern makes the system easily extensible for new business operations while maintaining backward compatibility with existing event handlers.

### src/apps/petstore/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/petstore/controller/ejb

The controller serves as an intermediary layer between the web tier and the business logic components, providing a structured approach to handling shopping operations. This sub-project implements the facade pattern for shopping-related functionality along with stateful session management for user interactions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Controlled access to shopping cart and customer management operations
- Stateful session management for maintaining user context
- Facade pattern implementation to simplify client interactions with multiple EJBs
- Service locator pattern usage for efficient EJB reference acquisition

#### Identified Design Elements

1. EJB Facade Pattern: ShoppingClientFacadeLocal provides a unified interface to multiple shopping-related EJBs, simplifying client interactions
2. Stateful Session Management: Maintains user identification and shopping context across multiple requests
3. Service Locator Implementation: Uses ServiceLocator to efficiently obtain EJB home interfaces
4. Exception Handling Strategy: Business logic exceptions are wrapped in GeneralFailureException for consistent error handling

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns through well-defined interfaces and implementation classes. The controller layer (ShoppingControllerEJB) delegates to the business facade (ShoppingClientFacadeEJB), which in turn manages access to specific business components like ShoppingCartLocal and CustomerLocal. This layered approach promotes maintainability and allows for independent evolution of the web tier and business logic. The use of local interfaces optimizes performance by enabling efficient in-container calls while preserving the architectural boundaries.
