# Pet Store Web Action Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates enterprise e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program processes web requests through a controller architecture and manages user interactions with the online store. This sub-project implements concrete action handlers for web requests along with form processing and event generation capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- HTTP request processing for core e-commerce operations
- Conversion of web form data into application events
- Session management for user authentication
- Shopping cart manipulation through web interfaces
- Customer account management and order processing

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Event-Based Architecture**: Action classes process HTTP requests and generate specific event objects (CartEvent, OrderEvent, etc.) that are handled by the application's event system
2. **Form Data Extraction**: Specialized methods extract and validate form fields from HTTP requests before converting them to domain objects
3. **Session Management**: Authentication state is maintained across requests with specific handling for sign-on and sign-off operations
4. **Validation Logic**: Required fields are validated with appropriate error handling through MissingFormDataException
5. **Component-Based Design**: Actions extend base support classes (HTMLActionSupport) for common functionality

## Overview
The architecture follows a controller pattern where each action class handles a specific domain function (cart management, user creation, order processing). These controllers extract data from HTTP requests, perform basic validation, and generate appropriate events for the application's business logic layer. The design emphasizes separation between the web presentation layer and the underlying business logic through this event-based approach. Error handling is implemented through exceptions, while session management provides user context across requests. The controllers maintain a clean separation of concerns by focusing solely on request processing and event generation.

## Business Functions

### Authentication
- `SignOffHTMLAction.java` : Handles user sign-off functionality in the Java Pet Store application

### Shopping Cart Management
- `CartHTMLAction.java` : Handles shopping cart actions in the Pet Store web application.

### User Management
- `CreateUserHTMLAction.java` : Handles user registration form submission in the Java Pet Store web application.

### Customer Management
- `CustomerHTMLAction.java` : Handles customer account creation and updates in the Java Pet Store web application.

### Order Processing
- `OrderHTMLAction.java` : Processes order form data and creates order events in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### CartHTMLAction.java

CartHTMLAction implements a controller action class that processes user interactions with the shopping cart in the Pet Store application. It extends HTMLActionSupport and handles three main cart operations: adding items (purchase), removing items, and updating item quantities. The perform method parses HTTP request parameters to determine the action type and creates appropriate CartEvent objects that will be processed by the application's event handling system. The class works with request parameters to extract item IDs and quantities, particularly handling the special case of batch updates where multiple item quantities are changed simultaneously.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 94`: Creates a map of item quantities from request parameters using a prefix-based naming convention for form fields
- `Line 115`: Uses a factory method pattern with CartEvent.createUpdateItemEvent() for batch updates rather than direct constructor
### CreateUserHTMLAction.java

CreateUserHTMLAction implements a web action handler that processes user registration form submissions in the Java Pet Store application. It extends HTMLActionSupport and implements the perform method to extract username and password parameters from HTTP requests. The class creates and returns a CreateUserEvent containing the user credentials for further processing by the application's event handling system. It also stores the username in the session for future reference using the SignOnFilter.USER_NAME attribute key.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 73`: Stores username in session using SignOnFilter.USER_NAME constant for maintaining user context across requests
- `Line 77`: Returns null event if username or password is missing, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the event handling system
### CustomerHTMLAction.java

CustomerHTMLAction implements an action handler for customer-related operations in the Java Pet Store web application. It processes HTTP requests for creating and updating customer accounts by extracting form data and generating appropriate events. The class extracts contact information, credit card details, and profile preferences from request parameters, validates required fields, and creates CustomerEvent objects. Key methods include perform() which determines the action type and creates the appropriate event, extractContactInfo(), extractCreditCard(), and extractProfileInfo() for form data processing. The class also handles session management for newly created customers through the doEnd() method.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 83`: The perform method determines the action type and creates appropriate CustomerEvent objects based on form submissions
- `Line 186`: Form validation with detailed missing field tracking that builds a list of all missing required fields
- `Line 257`: Session management for newly created customers integrates with SignOnFilter authentication system
### OrderHTMLAction.java

OrderHTMLAction implements a controller action that processes user order submissions in the Pet Store application. It extends HTMLActionSupport and handles HTTP requests containing shipping and billing information. The class extracts contact information from form data, validates required fields, and creates an OrderEvent with shipping, receiving, and credit card details. Key functionality includes form field validation, error handling for missing data, and event creation. Important methods include perform(), extractContactInfo(), and doEnd(). The class uses MissingFormDataException to handle validation errors and stores the order response as a request attribute.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: Creates a hardcoded credit card object rather than extracting it from the form
- `Line 84`: Form validation with detailed error tracking for missing fields
- `Line 153`: Uses request attributes to store exceptions for the view layer to handle
### SignOffHTMLAction.java

SignOffHTMLAction implements a controller action that processes user sign-off requests in the Java Pet Store application. It extends HTMLActionSupport and overrides the perform method to handle session invalidation when a user signs off. The class preserves the user's locale preference across the sign-off process by retrieving it before invalidating the session and setting it in the newly created session. After sign-off, it initializes a new PetstoreComponentManager and returns a ChangeLocaleEvent with the preserved locale to maintain the user's language preference.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 76`: Preserves user locale preference across session invalidation, maintaining user experience consistency
- `Line 81`: Creates a new component manager after sign-off, ensuring clean application state
