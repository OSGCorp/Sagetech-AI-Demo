# Pet Store EJB Controller Of Java Pet Store

The Pet Store EJB Controller is a Java subproject that implements the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) controller tier for the Java Pet Store e-commerce application. The controller serves as an intermediary layer between the web tier and the business logic components, providing a structured approach to handling shopping operations. This sub-project implements the facade pattern for shopping-related functionality along with stateful session management for user interactions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Controlled access to shopping cart and customer management operations
- Stateful session management for maintaining user context
- Facade pattern implementation to simplify client interactions with multiple EJBs
- Service locator pattern usage for efficient EJB reference acquisition

## Identified Design Elements

1. EJB Facade Pattern: ShoppingClientFacadeLocal provides a unified interface to multiple shopping-related EJBs, simplifying client interactions
2. Stateful Session Management: Maintains user identification and shopping context across multiple requests
3. Service Locator Implementation: Uses ServiceLocator to efficiently obtain EJB home interfaces
4. Exception Handling Strategy: Business logic exceptions are wrapped in GeneralFailureException for consistent error handling

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns through well-defined interfaces and implementation classes. The controller layer (ShoppingControllerEJB) delegates to the business facade (ShoppingClientFacadeEJB), which in turn manages access to specific business components like ShoppingCartLocal and CustomerLocal. This layered approach promotes maintainability and allows for independent evolution of the web tier and business logic. The use of local interfaces optimizes performance by enabling efficient in-container calls while preserving the architectural boundaries.

## Sub-Projects

### src/apps/petstore/src/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/petstore/controller/ejb/actions

The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases J2EE component integration within a web application framework. This sub-project implements the Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) action controllers along with the event handling mechanisms that drive the core business logic of the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven business logic processing
- Shopping cart and order management
- User authentication and registration
- Customer profile management
- Internationalization support through locale handling

#### Identified Design Elements

1. EJB Action Framework: Controllers extend EJBActionSupport to process specific event types and interact with appropriate EJB components
2. Facade Pattern Implementation: Actions use client facades like ShoppingClientFacadeLocal to access underlying business services
3. Event-Response Architecture: Each action processes specific event types and returns appropriate responses
4. Service Locator Pattern: Components use ServiceLocator to obtain references to EJB interfaces
5. Asynchronous Processing: Order submission uses AsyncSender for non-blocking order processing

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by dividing functionality into specialized action classes that handle specific business processes. The controllers bridge the web presentation layer with the EJB business components, providing a clean interface for event processing. The design supports internationalization through locale management, maintains shopping state across sessions, and implements secure user authentication. The order processing system demonstrates integration with asynchronous messaging for improved scalability and performance.

## Files
### ShoppingClientFacadeLocal.java

ShoppingClientFacadeLocal defines a local EJB interface that serves as a facade for shopping-related operations in the Pet Store application. It provides methods to access and manage a user's shopping cart and customer information. Key functionality includes retrieving the shopping cart, setting and getting the user ID, retrieving an existing customer, and creating a new customer. The interface extends EJBLocalObject and interacts with ShoppingCartLocal and CustomerLocal components to provide a unified access point for shopping operations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Interface extends EJBLocalObject to function as a local EJB component in the J2EE architecture
### ShoppingClientFacadeLocalEJB.java

ShoppingClientFacadeLocalEJB implements a session bean that serves as a facade to shopping-related EJBs in the Pet Store application. It manages access to ShoppingCartLocal and CustomerLocal EJBs, providing methods to create and retrieve these components. The class maintains user identification and uses ServiceLocator to obtain EJB homes. Key methods include getUserId(), setUserId(), getCustomer(), createCustomer(), and getShoppingCart(). The implementation handles exceptions by wrapping them in GeneralFailureException and includes standard EJB lifecycle methods.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 94`: Uses ServiceLocator pattern to abstract JNDI lookup complexity for EJB references
- `Line 108`: Creates customer with userId as primary key, demonstrating EJB entity creation pattern
- `Line 123`: Lazy initialization of shopping cart only when needed
### ShoppingClientFacadeLocalHome.java

ShoppingClientFacadeLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the ShoppingClientFacade Enterprise JavaBean in the Pet Store application. It extends EJBLocalHome and declares a single create() method that returns a ShoppingClientFacadeLocal object. This interface follows the EJB design pattern for local interfaces, enabling client components within the same JVM to create and access the ShoppingClientFacade bean without the overhead of remote method invocation. The create() method throws CreateException if bean creation fails.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: Implements EJBLocalHome interface, indicating this is a local component interface for container-managed EJB access
### ShoppingControllerEJB.java

ShoppingControllerEJB extends EJBControllerLocalEJB to implement the controller component for shopping operations in the Pet Store application. It initializes a state machine and provides access to the ShoppingClientFacade, which handles shopping-related business logic. The class uses the Service Locator pattern to obtain references to the ShoppingClientFacadeLocalHome. Key methods include ejbCreate() for initialization and getShoppingClientFacade() which lazily creates and returns the client facade. The class serves as an intermediary between the web tier and the business logic components.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 74`: Uses lazy initialization pattern for the client facade reference
- `Line 75`: Implements Service Locator pattern to obtain EJB references, reducing JNDI lookup code
- `Line 79`: Wraps checked exceptions in runtime GeneralFailureException for simplified error handling
### ShoppingControllerLocal.java

ShoppingControllerLocal interface extends EJBControllerLocal to provide access to application-specific stateful session beans in the Java Pet Store application. This interface serves as a bridge between the web application framework controller and shopping-related functionality. The interface declares a single method getShoppingClientFacade() that returns a ShoppingClientFacadeLocal object, which likely provides access to shopping cart operations and other e-commerce functionality. As an EJB local interface, it enables efficient local calls within the same JVM.
