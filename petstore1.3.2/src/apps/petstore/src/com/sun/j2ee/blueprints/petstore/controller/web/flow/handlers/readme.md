# Pet Store Flow Handler Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates best practices for building enterprise e-commerce systems using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements concrete flow handlers for managing navigation and page flow control, along with user interaction patterns throughout the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Controlled navigation between application screens
- Session-aware user flow management
- Post-action redirection logic
- Preservation of user context during multi-step processes

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Flow Handler Interface Implementation**: The architecture follows a consistent pattern where handlers implement the FlowHandler interface with processFlow() as the core navigation control method
2. **Session-Based Context Preservation**: Flow handlers maintain user context by storing and retrieving state information from the session
3. **Conditional Navigation Logic**: Navigation decisions are made based on application state and user actions
4. **URL Management**: The system tracks original URLs to enable proper return navigation after completing workflows

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between business logic and navigation control through the flow handler pattern. Each handler is responsible for a specific user workflow, such as account creation, with clear entry and exit points. The flow management system provides consistent user experience by maintaining context across multiple screens while allowing for conditional branching based on user actions or system state. This design enables the application to guide users through complex processes while maintaining their session state and ensuring they reach appropriate destinations upon completion.

## Business Functions

### User Management
- `CreateUserFlowHandler.java` : Flow handler that directs users to appropriate screens after account creation.

## Files
### CreateUserFlowHandler.java

CreateUserFlowHandler implements a flow handler responsible for redirecting users to the appropriate screen after they create a new account. It works with the SignOn component to determine where users should be directed after account creation. The class implements the FlowHandler interface with three methods: doStart() which is empty, processFlow() which retrieves the original URL from the session and determines the appropriate forward destination, and doEnd() which is also empty. The key functionality is in processFlow(), which checks if the forward screen is 'customer.do' and returns 'MAIN_SCREEN' in that case, otherwise returns the original URL.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 60`: The handler specifically checks for 'customer.do' URL and redirects to 'MAIN_SCREEN' instead, showing special case handling in the navigation flow.
