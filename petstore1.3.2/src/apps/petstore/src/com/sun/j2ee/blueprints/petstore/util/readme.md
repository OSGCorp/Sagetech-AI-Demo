# Pet Store Utility Classes Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE reference application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices. The Pet Store Utility Classes sub-project implements core infrastructure components and shared utilities that support the application's cross-cutting concerns and integration requirements. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Centralized constant management for web tier data exchange
- Standardized JNDI naming conventions for EJB lookups
- Consistent access to application resources across components
- Decoupled service location from business logic implementation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Centralized Constants Management**: The utility classes define application-wide constants in a single location to ensure consistency and reduce duplication
2. **Service Locator Pattern Implementation**: JNDI names are abstracted through constants to decouple service location from business logic
3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns Separation**: Common functionality used across multiple application layers is isolated in utility classes
4. **Configuration Externalization**: Application configuration elements are separated from implementation code

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes maintainability through centralization of common constants and naming conventions. The PetstoreKeys class extends the framework's WebKeys to provide application-specific constants for web tier data exchange, while JNDINames encapsulates all EJB service location information. This design isolates the impact of infrastructure changes, allowing developers to modify deployment configurations without affecting business logic. The utility classes follow Java best practices by preventing instantiation and providing only static access to constants.

## Business Functions

### Application Constants
- `PetstoreKeys.java` : Defines constant keys used for data storage in the PetStore application's web tier.
- `JNDINames.java` : Defines JNDI names for EJB home objects in the Java Pet Store application.

## Files
### JNDINames.java

JNDINames is a utility class that centralizes the storage of internal JNDI names for various Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) home objects used throughout the Pet Store application. It prevents instantiation through a private constructor and provides public static final String constants for each EJB home object reference. These constants include references to ShoppingController, ShoppingClientFacade, UniqueIdGenerator, SignOn, Customer, ShoppingCart, and AsyncSender EJBs. The class documentation notes that any changes to these JNDI names must also be reflected in the application's deployment descriptors.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Private constructor prevents instantiation, enforcing usage as a static utility class
- `Line 51`: All JNDI names use the java:comp/env/ namespace prefix, following J2EE best practices for portable JNDI lookups
### PetstoreKeys.java

PetstoreKeys extends WebKeys and defines constant string keys used throughout the Java Pet Store application for storing and retrieving data in different web tier scopes. The class contains keys for cart, customer, order response, and shopping client facade objects. These constants ensure consistent naming when storing and retrieving objects across JSP pages and Java components. The class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it only serves as a container for static constants.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: Class extends WebKeys from the Web Application Framework (WAF) to inherit base keys while adding application-specific ones
- `Line 48`: Private constructor prevents instantiation, enforcing usage as a pure utility class for constants
