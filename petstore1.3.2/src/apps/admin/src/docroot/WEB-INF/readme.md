# Admin Web Application Configuration Of Java Pet Store

The Admin Web Application Configuration is a Java-based component that provides the administrative interface for the Java Pet Store application. The module implements secure access control, servlet request processing, and integration with Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components. This subproject configures the web-facing administrative functionality that allows authorized users to manage the Pet Store's backend operations.

The configuration establishes a robust security model through form-based authentication, ensuring that only users with the 'administrator' role can access sensitive administrative functions. It provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Secure administrative access through role-based authentication
- Request processing via dedicated servlet components
- Integration with business logic through EJB references
- Session management with defined timeout parameters

## Identified Design Elements

1. Role-Based Security Model: Implements form-based authentication requiring the 'administrator' role, creating a secure administrative interface
2. Dual Request Processors: Separates administrative (AdminRequestProcessor) and application (ApplRequestProcessor) request handling for better separation of concerns
3. EJB Integration Architecture: Establishes connections to both remote and local EJBs, bridging the presentation layer with the business logic tier
4. Configurable Session Management: Implements session timeout controls to enhance security and resource management

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers. The web.xml deployment descriptor serves as the central configuration point, defining security constraints, servlet mappings, and EJB references. This design enables administrators to securely manage the Pet Store application while maintaining the scalability and maintainability principles of the J2EE platform.

## Business Functions

### Configuration
- `web.xml` : Web application deployment descriptor for the PetStore Admin module defining servlets, security, and EJB references.

## Files
### web.xml

This web.xml deployment descriptor configures the web application component of the PetStore Admin module. It defines two servlets (AdminRequestProcessor and ApplRequestProcessor) with their URL mappings, sets a 54-minute session timeout, and specifies index.html as the welcome file. The file implements form-based authentication security constraints requiring the 'administrator' role to access the AdminRequestProcessor. It also defines EJB references including a remote OPCAdminFacadeRemote and a local AsyncSender EJB, establishing the connection points between the web tier and business logic components.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 86`: Security constraint implementation restricting AdminRequestProcessor access to users with administrator role
- `Line 98`: Form-based authentication configuration with custom login and error pages
- `Line 111`: Remote EJB reference declaration for OPC admin functionality
- `Line 118`: Local EJB reference with explicit EJB link to AsyncSenderEJB for messaging
