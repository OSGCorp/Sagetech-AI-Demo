# Admin Web Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates J2EE best practices through a functional e-commerce implementation. The program processes online pet store transactions and provides administrative capabilities for order management. This sub-project implements the administrative web interface controllers along with XML-based processing for rich client interactions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request handling for both web-based and rich client administrative interfaces
- Dynamic JNLP file generation for Java Web Start client deployment
- XML processing for order management operations
- Business delegation pattern implementation for EJB interaction

## Identified Design Elements

1. Dual Interface Support: The architecture supports both web-based administration through HTML interfaces and rich client interaction through XML-based communication protocols
2. Business Delegate Pattern: Isolates presentation layer from implementation details of backend EJB services through the AdminRequestBD class
3. Service Locator Integration: Manages connections to remote EJBs efficiently to reduce resource overhead
4. Asynchronous Processing: Implements message-based order updates to improve system responsiveness

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean separation between presentation and business logic layers. The AdminRequestProcessor handles web-based administrative requests and JNLP generation, while ApplRequestProcessor manages XML communication with rich clients. Both controllers delegate business operations to AdminRequestBD, which interfaces with the backend EJB services. The design emphasizes maintainability through proper exception handling with custom AdminBDException objects and scalability through asynchronous processing for order updates. This modular approach allows for independent evolution of the web interface and business logic components.

## Business Functions

### Order Management
- `AdminRequestProcessor.java` : Servlet that processes admin web client requests and generates Java Web Start JNLP files for the admin rich client application.
- `ApplRequestProcessor.java` : A servlet that processes XML requests from rich clients for the PetStore admin interface, handling order management and chart data.
- `AdminRequestBD.java` : Business delegate class for handling admin requests to the OPC Admin Facade EJB.

### Error Handling
- `AdminBDException.java` : Custom exception class for the admin business delegate component in Java Pet Store.

## Files
### AdminBDException.java

AdminBDException implements a simple custom exception class for the admin business delegate component in the Java Pet Store application. It extends the standard Java Exception class and provides two constructors: a default constructor with no parameters and another that accepts a String message parameter. This exception is likely used to handle and propagate errors specific to the admin module's business delegate layer.
### AdminRequestBD.java

AdminRequestBD implements a business delegate that provides an interface between the admin web tier and the OPC Admin Facade EJB. It handles operations like retrieving orders by status, updating orders via asynchronous messaging, and fetching chart information for revenue or order analytics. The class manages connections to remote EJBs through the ServiceLocator pattern and handles exceptions by wrapping them in AdminBDException. Key methods include getOrdersByStatus(), updateOrders(), and getChartInfo(), which communicate with backend services while isolating the presentation layer from implementation details.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 76`: Uses ServiceLocator pattern to obtain remote EJB references, demonstrating J2EE best practices for resource lookup
- `Line 106`: Implements asynchronous messaging pattern by sending XML order approvals through AsyncSender EJB
- `Line 134`: Provides data for charting functionality with flexible parameters for date ranges and categories
### AdminRequestProcessor.java

AdminRequestProcessor implements a servlet that handles requests from the Pet Store Admin web client. Its primary function is generating dynamic JNLP files for Java Web Start to launch the rich client application. The servlet processes GET requests by forwarding to index.jsp and handles POST requests based on the 'currentScreen' parameter, supporting 'logout' and 'manageorders' actions. The buildJNLP method constructs the XML-based JNLP file with application information, resources, and runtime arguments including server details and session ID for authentication.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 65`: Dynamically builds a JNLP file with server information and session ID for authentication
- `Line 94`: Passes the session ID as an argument to maintain authentication state between web and rich client
### ApplRequestProcessor.java

ApplRequestProcessor is a servlet that handles XML-based requests from rich clients for the PetStore admin interface. It processes three main request types: GETORDERS (retrieves orders by status), UPDATESTATUS (updates order statuses), and REVENUE/ORDERS (generates chart data). The servlet authenticates sessions, parses incoming XML requests, and generates XML responses. It works with AdminRequestBD to interact with the business layer and uses OrderApproval and ChangedOrder classes to handle order updates. Key methods include processRequest(), getOrders(), updateOrders(), and getChartInfo(), which form the core request handling functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 84`: Uses session validation as security check before processing any requests
- `Line 107`: XML processing pattern where incoming requests are parsed and routed to specific handlers based on request type
- `Line 181`: Manual XML transformation between schemas instead of using XSLT
- `Line 235`: Dynamic XML response generation based on request parameters and data type
