# Admin Client Resources Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation demonstrating J2EE platform capabilities through an e-commerce application. The Admin Client Resources subproject implements the internationalization and localization framework for the administration interface of the application. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Localized text resources for all UI components in multiple languages
- Consistent presentation layer text management across the admin application
- Internationalization support through language-specific property files
- Structured organization of UI text elements by functional area

## Identified Design Elements

1. Comprehensive Resource Organization: Resources are logically grouped by functional areas (actions, panels, dialogs, tables) for maintainability
2. Internationalization Framework: Base properties file with language-specific variants (e.g., German) following Java's resource bundle pattern
3. UI Component Integration: Direct mapping between property keys and UI component text attributes including labels, tooltips, and mnemonics
4. Consistent Naming Conventions: Hierarchical naming scheme for properties that reflects the application's component structure

## Overview
The architecture follows Java's internationalization best practices with resource bundles that separate UI text from application code. The primary `petstore.properties` file serves as the default locale, while language-specific variants (like `petstore_de.properties`) provide translations. The organization of properties mirrors the application's structure, with sections dedicated to specific functional areas such as order management, sales reporting, and status messaging. This design enables seamless language switching and facilitates maintenance by centralizing all user-facing text resources.

## Business Functions

### Localization Resources
- `petstore.properties` : Properties file defining UI strings and labels for the Pet Store Admin client application.
- `petstore_de.properties` : German language resource file for the Pet Store Admin client application interface.

## Files
### petstore.properties

This properties file contains localized strings for the Pet Store Administration client application. It defines text resources for UI components including action names, mnemonics, tooltips, panel titles, button labels, dialog messages, and table column headers. The file organizes strings into logical sections for application actions, orders panels, frames/dialogs, sales tab elements, status bar messages, table columns, and chart configuration. These properties support internationalization and provide consistent text throughout the application interface.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-18`: Comprehensive action definition pattern with name, mnemonic, tooltip and description for each UI action
- `Line 47-52`: Table column naming convention that prefixes each property with the component name (OrdersTable)
- `Line 54-62`: Chart configuration properties that mix display text with numerical configuration values
### petstore_de.properties

This properties file contains German language translations for the Pet Store Admin client application. It defines localized text strings for UI elements including menu actions, dialog messages, button labels, and status indicators. The file organizes translations for various application components including file operations, order management panels, sales charts, and status messages. Key sections include action names with mnemonics, order panel labels, dialog messages, chart configuration strings, and status indicators for order processing states and pet categories.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 1-15`: Implements complete menu action localization with name, mnemonic, tooltip and description for each action
