# Admin Client Components Of Java Pet Store

The Admin Client Components is a Java-based subproject that provides administrative functionality for the Java Pet Store application. The subproject implements a rich client interface for order management and sales analytics, along with the necessary communication infrastructure to interact with the server-side components. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Order management (viewing, approving, denying, and updating order statuses)
- Sales data visualization through interactive charts (pie and bar charts)
- Asynchronous client-server communication
- Data filtering and sorting capabilities

## Identified Design Elements

1. **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation between data models (DataSource), view components (various panels), and controller logic (actions)
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Background task execution through WorkQueue and ServerAction to maintain UI responsiveness
3. **Component Reusability**: Abstract base classes and interfaces (Chart, TableMap, AbstractItemAction) promote code reuse
4. **Proxy Pattern**: PetStoreProxy interface with HTTP implementation abstracts server communication details
5. **Observer Pattern**: PropertyChangeListeners enable loose coupling between components that need to react to data changes

## Overview
The architecture is built around a central DataSource that manages communication with the server through a PetStoreProxy implementation. UI components include specialized panels for order management (OrdersViewPanel, OrdersApprovePanel) and sales visualization (PieChartPanel, BarChartPanel). The design emphasizes thread safety with background processing for server requests, while maintaining a responsive UI. Table components feature advanced functionality like sorting and custom rendering. The modular design allows for easy extension of administrative capabilities while maintaining consistent behavior across the application.

### ToggleActionPropertyChangeListener.java

ToggleActionPropertyChangeListener implements a PropertyChangeListener that ensures toggle state synchronization between UI components created from the same AbstractItemAction. When attached to AbstractButton instances (buttons or menu items), it listens for 'selected' property changes and updates the button's selected state accordingly. This maintains consistency across multiple UI components controlled by the same action. The class contains a reference to the AbstractButton it monitors and implements the propertyChange method to handle selection state changes.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: The comment indicates the button reference should be a WeakRef to prevent memory leaks since it may become unreachable
### WorkQueue.java

WorkQueue implements a thread-safe queue for asynchronous task execution using a producer-consumer pattern. It creates a dedicated worker thread that processes Runnable tasks submitted to the queue. The class provides methods to enqueue work items and stop the queue processing. When tasks are added to the queue, the worker thread is notified and executes them sequentially. Key components include the queue (implemented as a LinkedList), a worker thread that runs at minimum priority, and synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety. Important methods include enqueue(Runnable), stop(), and the inner WorkerThread class that handles the execution loop.

 **Code Landmarks**
