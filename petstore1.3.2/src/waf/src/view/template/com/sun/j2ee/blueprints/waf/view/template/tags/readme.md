# WAF Template Tags Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices for e-commerce systems. The program implements a complete online pet store with catalog browsing, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. This sub-project implements custom JSP tag libraries for templating along with parameter-based content insertion mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Template-based content management for consistent UI presentation
- Dynamic content insertion into predefined page templates
- Conditional rendering based on parameter configurations
- Support for both direct text inclusion and JSP fragment inclusion

## Identified Design Elements

1. Parameter-Based Content Insertion: The templating system uses a Screen object to retrieve and manage Parameter objects that control content insertion
2. Dual Rendering Modes: Supports both direct text inclusion and inclusion of JSP fragments through RequestDispatcher
3. Template Composition: Enables building complex pages from reusable template components
4. Conditional Content Rendering: Content can be conditionally displayed based on Parameter configuration flags

## Overview
The architecture follows JSP custom tag development patterns, extending the standard JSP functionality with template-specific behaviors. The InsertTag implementation serves as the core mechanism for template content insertion, working with Screen and Parameter objects to determine what content to display and how to render it. This approach promotes separation of concerns by isolating presentation logic from business logic and provides a consistent templating system throughout the application. The design facilitates maintainability by centralizing template management and supporting reusable UI components.

## Business Functions

### Template System
- `InsertTag.java` : Custom JSP tag that inserts template content or direct text into JSP pages.

## Files
### InsertTag.java

InsertTag implements a custom JSP tag that facilitates template-based content insertion in JSP pages. It retrieves a Screen object from the request and uses it to fetch Parameter objects based on a specified parameter name. The tag supports two insertion modes: direct inclusion of text content and inclusion of JSP fragments via RequestDispatcher. Key functionality includes parameter retrieval from the Screen object and conditional rendering based on the Parameter's direct flag. Important methods include doStartTag() and doEndTag(), with fields for parameter name, Parameter reference, Screen object, and directInclude flag.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 76`: Uses pageContext.getOut().flush() to ensure any buffered content is written before tag processing
- `Line 89`: Implements conditional rendering logic based on Parameter.isDirect() flag
- `Line 99`: Uses RequestDispatcher.include() for including JSP fragments dynamically
