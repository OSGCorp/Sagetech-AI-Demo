# Subproject WAF View Templates Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and e-commerce functionality using J2EE technologies. The program implements a complete online shopping experience and showcases J2EE best practices. This sub-project implements a template-based view rendering system along with screen definition management for the MVC architecture.  This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- XML-driven screen definition and templating
- Locale-specific content rendering
- Parameter management for view templates
- Screen state caching and transaction management

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The WAF View Templates system provides a flexible templating framework that separates presentation logic from business logic. It uses XML-based screen definitions loaded by ScreenDefinitionDAO and managed by the Screens class to define UI layouts. The TemplateServlet handles HTTP requests, determines appropriate templates, and renders views with proper locale support. Screen objects store template references and parameters, while the Parameter class manages key-value pairs for template rendering. The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/view/template/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/view/template/tags

The program implements a complete online pet store with catalog browsing, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. This sub-project implements custom JSP tag libraries for templating along with parameter-based content insertion mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Template-based content management for consistent UI presentation
- Dynamic content insertion into predefined page templates
- Conditional rendering based on parameter configurations
- Support for both direct text inclusion and JSP fragment inclusion

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Parameter-Based Content Insertion: The templating system uses a Screen object to retrieve and manage Parameter objects that control content insertion
2. Dual Rendering Modes: Supports both direct text inclusion and inclusion of JSP fragments through RequestDispatcher
3. Template Composition: Enables building complex pages from reusable template components
4. Conditional Content Rendering: Content can be conditionally displayed based on Parameter configuration flags

#### Overview
The architecture follows JSP custom tag development patterns, extending the standard JSP functionality with template-specific behaviors. The InsertTag implementation serves as the core mechanism for template content insertion, working with Screen and Parameter objects to determine what content to display and how to render it. This approach promotes separation of concerns by isolating presentation logic from business logic and provides a consistent templating system throughout the application. The design facilitates maintainability by centralizing template management and supporting reusable UI components.

## Business Functions

### View Templating System
- `Parameter.java` : Represents a key-value parameter with direct/indirect flag for template processing.
- `Screens.java` : Manages screen definitions and their associated templates for the web application framework.
- `ScreenDefinitionDAO.java` : Data access object for parsing XML screen definition files that define UI templates and navigation flow in the WAF framework.
- `TemplateServlet.java` : Servlet that implements a template system for web page rendering based on screen definitions loaded from XML files.
- `Screen.java` : Represents a screen component in the web application framework's templating system.

## Files
### Parameter.java

Parameter implements a simple serializable class that stores a key-value pair along with a boolean flag indicating whether the value should be used directly or requires further processing. The class provides basic getter methods to access the key, value, and direct flag properties. It also includes a toString() method that returns a string representation of the Parameter object for debugging purposes. This class is part of the WAF (Web Application Framework) template system used in the Java Pet Store application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: Implements Serializable to allow Parameter objects to be persisted or transferred across networks
### Screen.java

Screen implements a serializable class that represents a screen in the web application framework's view templating system. It stores a screen name, an optional template name, and a collection of parameters as a HashMap. The class provides methods to retrieve the template name, access all parameters as a HashMap, or get a specific parameter by key. It also includes a toString() method that returns a string representation of the screen object with its name and parameters.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: The class implements Serializable, allowing Screen objects to be persisted or transmitted across networks.
- `Line 51`: Parameters are stored in a HashMap, providing flexible key-value storage for screen configuration.
### ScreenDefinitionDAO.java

ScreenDefinitionDAO provides XML parsing functionality for screen definition files in the web application framework. It loads and parses XML documents that define screen layouts, templates, and parameters for the application's UI. Key functionality includes loading XML documents, extracting screen definitions with their associated templates and parameters, and handling language-specific configurations. The class contains methods like loadScreenDefinitions(), getScreens(), getTemplates(), and getParameters() that transform XML elements into Java objects representing screens, templates, and parameters. It maintains constants for XML element names and attributes used in parsing the configuration files.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 72`: Uses JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) to parse XML configuration files
- `Line 103`: Implements error handling that logs errors but allows processing to continue when possible
- `Line 126`: Supports internationalization through language-specific screen definitions
- `Line 168`: Implements parameter handling with a 'direct' attribute flag for template rendering control
- `Line 194`: Uses recursive node traversal to extract nested XML configuration values
### Screens.java

Screens implements a class that manages screen definitions and their associated templates for the web application framework. It maintains two HashMaps: screenMap stores Screen objects keyed by screen names, and templateMap stores template URLs keyed by template names. The class provides methods to add screens and templates, retrieve screen objects, check if screens or templates exist, and get template URLs for specific screens. If a screen doesn't have a defined template, it falls back to the default template. Key methods include addScreen(), addTemplate(), getScreen(), containsScreen(), containsTemplate(), and getTemplate().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 49`: The class implements Serializable, allowing screen configurations to be persisted or transmitted across the network.
- `Line 83`: Error handling prints to standard error rather than throwing exceptions, which could lead to silent failures in production.
- `Line 94`: Template resolution implements a fallback mechanism to the default template when a specific template is not defined.
### TemplateServlet.java

TemplateServlet implements a template-based view rendering system for the WAF (Web Application Framework). It loads screen definitions from XML files for different locales and manages the rendering of web pages using these templates. Key functionality includes initializing screen definitions for multiple languages, handling HTTP requests by determining the appropriate screen template, supporting locale-specific content, and managing previous screen state caching. Important methods include init(), process(), initScreens(), and insertTemplate(). The class maintains maps of screen definitions and supports transaction management when forwarding requests to templates.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: Implements caching configuration for previous screen attributes and parameters based on servlet initialization parameters
- `Line 159`: Handles special 'PREVIOUS_SCREEN' functionality to return to previous screens with state restoration
- `Line 242`: Wraps request dispatcher calls in UserTransaction for efficient local EJB access
