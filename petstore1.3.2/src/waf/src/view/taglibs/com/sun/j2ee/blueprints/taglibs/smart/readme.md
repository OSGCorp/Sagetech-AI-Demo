# Smart JSP Tag Library Of Java Pet Store

The Smart JSP Tag Library is a Java-based custom tag library that enhances the presentation layer of the Java Pet Store application. The library provides reusable UI components that simplify JSP development while enforcing consistent styling and behavior. This sub-project implements advanced form handling with validation capabilities along with client-state management for improved user experience. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Custom form components with built-in validation
- Client-state preservation across page requests
- Content caching with configurable scopes and expiration
- Hierarchical tag relationships for complex UI component composition

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Component Hierarchy System**: Tags are designed to work together in parent-child relationships (e.g., SelectTag with OptionTag, InputTag with ValueTag) to build complex UI components
2. **Automatic Form Validation**: FormTag generates JavaScript validation code for fields registered through its validation system
3. **State Preservation**: ClientStateTag serializes and preserves application state across requests using hidden form fields
4. **Content Caching**: CacheTag provides multi-level caching (context, session, request, page) with configurable expiration policies

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes component reusability through a hierarchical tag system where child tags communicate with parent tags to build complex UI elements. The library handles common web development challenges like form validation, state management, and content caching. Each tag follows a consistent lifecycle pattern by extending BodyTagSupport and implementing appropriate tag processing methods. The design separates presentation concerns from business logic, allowing developers to create rich interfaces with minimal custom code while maintaining the application's visual consistency.

## Files
### CacheTag.java

CacheTag implements a custom JSP tag for caching content in different scopes (context, session, request, page) with configurable expiration. It stores content in an inner Entry class that tracks creation time and duration. The tag evaluates its body only when no valid cached content exists, otherwise it outputs the cached content. Key functionality includes checking cache expiration, storing content with scope-appropriate attributes, and managing the cache lifecycle. Important methods include doStartTag(), doEndTag(), getEntry(), and removeEntry(). The inner Entry class handles content storage and expiration checking.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 51`: Creates a unique cache key by combining request URL, tag name, and query string
- `Line 104`: Implements scope-based attribute storage using the JSP pageContext object
- `Line 159`: Inner class Entry implements expiration logic using system timestamps
### CheckboxTag.java

CheckboxTag implements a custom JSP tag that renders HTML checkbox input elements within forms. It extends BodyTagSupport and manages checkbox attributes including name, value, and checked state. The tag generates the appropriate HTML markup for checkbox inputs and supports integration with FormTag ancestors. Key methods include setName(), setValue(), setChecked(), doStartTag(), and doEndTag(), which handles the actual HTML generation and output. The class properly resets its state after each use to ensure clean reuse within JSP pages.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 77`: The doEndTag() method constructs HTML dynamically using StringBuffer for efficiency
- `Line 89`: The tag properly resets all attributes in the finally block to ensure clean state for reuse
- `Line 79`: The tag finds its ancestor FormTag using findAncestorWithClass but doesn't actually use it
### CheckedTag.java

CheckedTag implements a JSP custom tag that works in conjunction with CheckboxTag to determine if a checkbox should be checked. It extends BodyTagSupport and overrides the doAfterBody method to evaluate its body content. The tag examines the string value from its body content and sets the parent CheckboxTag's checked state to true if the value is not null and not equal to 'true' (case-insensitive). After processing, it clears the body content and skips further body evaluation.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: The tag uses findAncestorWithClass to locate its parent CheckboxTag, demonstrating JSP tag collaboration pattern
- `Line 55`: Unusual logic where the checkbox is checked when the value is NOT 'true', which is counter-intuitive
### ClientStateTag.java

ClientStateTag implements a custom JSP tag that preserves client state across page requests by serializing request attributes and parameters as hidden form fields. It generates a form with a button or image that, when clicked, submits the preserved state to a target URL. The tag encodes serializable request attributes using Base64 encoding, preserves request parameters, and adds metadata like the referring URL and screen. Key functionality includes configurable encoding of request attributes and parameters, support for both button and image submission, and parameter addition through sub-tags. Important methods include doStartTag(), doEndTag(), and putParameter().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 137`: Uses Base64 encoding to serialize Java objects into hidden form fields for client-side state preservation
- `Line 163`: Implements selective serialization by checking if objects implement java.io.Serializable before encoding
- `Line 91`: Integrates with WAF controller by preserving referring_URL and referring_screen for navigation flow
### ClientStateValueTag.java

ClientStateValueTag implements a JSP tag handler that works as a child tag for ClientStateTag. It captures name-value pairs that are passed to the parent ClientStateTag for client-side state management. The class extends BodyTagSupport and overrides doStartTag() and doEndTag() methods. In doEndTag(), it finds its parent ClientStateTag and calls putParameter() to store the name-value pair. Key instance variables include name and value strings, with corresponding setter methods setName() and setValue().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 65`: Tag implementation finds its parent tag using findAncestorWithClass() to establish parent-child relationship for parameter passing
- `Line 67`: Tag cleans up its state by nullifying name and value fields after processing to prevent data leakage between requests
### FormTag.java

FormTag implements a custom JSP tag that generates HTML forms with built-in JavaScript validation. It extends BodyTagSupport to process form content and automatically adds client-side validation for fields registered through putValidatedField(). The tag supports standard form attributes (name, action, method) and generates JavaScript that validates required fields before submission. Key methods include doStartTag(), doAfterBody(), and doEndTag() which handle the tag lifecycle and generate both the form HTML and validation script. Important variables include validatedFields (stores field validation requirements), name, action, method, and formHTML.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 49`: Uses TreeMap to store validated fields, ensuring consistent ordering of validation rules
- `Line 86`: Dynamically generates JavaScript validation function specific to the form's fields
- `Line 121`: Properly resets all instance variables after tag processing to prevent data leakage between requests
### InputTag.java

InputTag implements a custom JSP tag that generates HTML input elements for web forms. It extends BodyTagSupport and provides attributes for common input properties like type, name, value, size, maxlength, and CSS class. The tag integrates with FormTag for validation by registering validated fields. During rendering, it constructs an HTML input element with all specified attributes. Key methods include doStartTag() and doEndTag(), which handle the tag lifecycle and HTML generation. The class resets all attributes after each use to maintain a clean state for subsequent invocations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 74`: Finds ancestor FormTag to register this field for validation when validation attribute is set
- `Line 79`: Dynamically builds HTML input element with conditional attributes based on set properties
- `Line 97`: Resets all attributes to null/0 after rendering to prevent state persistence between tag usages
### NameTag.java

NameTag implements a custom JSP tag that defines the 'name' attribute for InputTag components in the Java Pet Store application. The class extends BodyTagSupport and overrides the doAfterBody() method to extract content from the tag body. It locates its parent InputTag using findAncestorWithClass(), sets the name attribute with the body content if not empty, clears the body content, and returns SKIP_BODY to prevent further processing. This tag is part of the smart taglib collection used for form handling in the Web Application Framework (WAF).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 51`: Uses findAncestorWithClass() to locate parent InputTag, demonstrating JSP tag hierarchy navigation
- `Line 54`: Implements conditional logic to only set name attribute when body content exists and isn't empty
### OptionTag.java

OptionTag implements a custom JSP tag that represents an HTML option element within a select dropdown. It extends BodyTagSupport to process the content between opening and closing tags. The class captures both the value attribute and the body content text of the option element, then passes this information to its parent SelectTag. The doAfterBody() method handles the core functionality by retrieving the parent SelectTag, extracting the body content, and registering the option with the parent using putOption(). The class ensures proper handling of empty values and text content.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 57`: Uses findAncestorWithClass to locate parent SelectTag, demonstrating JSP tag hierarchy navigation
- `Line 60`: Performs validation checks on both value attribute and body content before adding to parent
### SelectTag.java

SelectTag implements a JSP custom tag that generates HTML select dropdown menus. It extends BodyTagSupport and manages the rendering of select elements with options. The tag supports setting a selected value, size, name attribute, and editability. Key functionality includes storing option values and their display text in a TreeMap, generating the appropriate HTML markup based on properties, and handling the tag lifecycle. Important methods include doStartTag(), doEndTag(), and setter methods for tag attributes. The class resets its state after rendering to ensure proper reuse.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 49`: Uses TreeMap to maintain sorted order of options in the dropdown menu
- `Line 84`: Conditionally renders either an interactive select dropdown or static text based on the editable property
- `Line 107`: Properly resets all instance variables after rendering to prevent state leakage between tag usages
### SelectedTag.java

SelectedTag implements a JSP tag that works with SelectTag to determine which option should be selected in an HTML select element. It extends BodyTagSupport and processes its body content to extract the selected value. The doAfterBody() method finds the parent SelectTag, retrieves the body content as a string, and if valid, sets this as the selected value in the parent tag. After processing, it clears the body content and skips further body evaluation. This tag is part of the smart taglib collection in the WAF (Web Application Framework) component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 56`: The tag finds its parent SelectTag using findAncestorWithClass, demonstrating JSP tag hierarchy navigation
### ValueTag.java

ValueTag implements a JSP tag handler that extracts content from its body and sets it as the value attribute of its parent InputTag. The class extends BodyTagSupport and overrides the doAfterBody() method to find its ancestor InputTag, retrieve the body content, and if the content is not empty, set it as the value of the input tag. After processing, it clears the body content and skips further body evaluation. This provides a convenient way to set input field values in JSP pages.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Uses findAncestorWithClass to locate parent InputTag, demonstrating JSP tag collaboration pattern
