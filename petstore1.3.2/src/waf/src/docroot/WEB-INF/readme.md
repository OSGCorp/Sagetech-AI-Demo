# WAF Web Application Configuration Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using the J2EE 1.3 platform. The WAF Web Application Configuration sub-project implements the presentation and controller layers of the application through a structured MVC framework. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Configurable screen definitions and layouts through XML-based templating
- Event-to-action mappings for handling user interactions
- URL pattern routing to appropriate controller components
- Internationalization support through locale-specific configurations

## Identified Design Elements

1. MVC Architecture Implementation: Clear separation between presentation (screen definitions), control flow (mappings), and application deployment (web.xml)
2. Template-Based UI Composition: Screen definitions allow for modular UI assembly with reusable components like banners, sidebars, and footers
3. Configurable Event Handling: XML-based event mappings connect user actions to appropriate EJB controller components
4. Internationalization Support: Locale-specific screen definitions enable multilingual presentation

## Overview
The architecture follows J2EE best practices with MainServlet and TemplateServlet handling request processing and view rendering respectively. The mappings.xml file defines the application's control flow by connecting events to actions and URLs to screens. Screen definitions in screendefinitions_en_US.xml provide a template-based approach to UI composition, promoting reusability and consistent layouts. The web.xml deployment descriptor establishes servlet configurations, session management, and EJB references that bridge the web tier to the business logic layer through the EJBController.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/docroot/WEB-INF/xml

The program handles product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, and order processing while showcasing J2EE best practices. This sub-project implements the XML-based configuration for the Web Application Framework (WAF) that drives the application's navigation flow and screen rendering. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Declarative URL-to-screen mapping without code changes
- Centralized navigation flow control and authentication requirements
- Template-based UI composition with consistent layouts
- Exception handling and error screen routing

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Request Flow Management**: The configuration defines URL patterns and maps them to specific handlers and screens, controlling the application's navigation paths
2. **Template-Based View Composition**: Screen definitions specify how UI components (header, body, footer) combine to create consistent page layouts
3. **Authentication Control**: URL mappings can specify whether user authentication is required for specific application sections
4. **Exception Handling Framework**: Centralized configuration for routing exceptions to appropriate error screens

#### Overview
The architecture employs a separation between navigation logic (requestmappings.xml) and presentation structure (screendefinitions.xml), allowing independent modification of either aspect. The XML-based approach eliminates hardcoded navigation paths in Java code, making the application more maintainable. This configuration-driven framework supports consistent UI rendering across the application while providing clear control points for authentication requirements and error handling. The system enables developers to modify application flow and screen layouts without changing compiled code.

## Business Functions

### Web Application Configuration
- `mappings.xml` : XML configuration file defining event and URL mappings for the Web Application Framework (WAF).
- `screendefinitions_en_US.xml` : XML configuration file defining screen layouts and templates for the WAF component of Java Pet Store.
- `web.xml` : Web application deployment descriptor for the Web Application Framework component of Java Pet Store.

## Files
### mappings.xml

This mappings.xml file configures the Web Application Framework (WAF) component of Java Pet Store by defining event-to-action and URL-to-screen mappings. It establishes relationships between event classes and their corresponding EJB action handlers, as well as URL patterns and their web action classes. The file includes mappings for locale change functionality through different endpoints ('changelocale.do' and 'changeclientchachelinklocale.do'), with the latter using a flow handler. It also defines an exception mapping that routes GeneralFailureException to an error screen.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Defines event-mapping that connects ChangeLocaleEvent to its EJB action implementation
- `Line 49`: Implements flow handler integration for client-side state management with the 'useFlowHandler' attribute
### screendefinitions_en_US.xml

This XML configuration file defines screen layouts for the Web Application Framework (WAF) component of Java Pet Store. It establishes a default template and defines multiple screen configurations that specify UI components like banner, sidebar, body, and footer JSPs for different application pages. The file includes a special template definition and screen definitions for various functionality including locale handling, tag libraries, templating, and form components. Each screen definition contains parameters that map UI elements to specific JSP files, with titles provided as direct values.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 39`: Defines a default template that applies to all screens unless overridden
- `Line 41-43`: Defines a named template 'special' that can be referenced by specific screens
- `Line 77`: Screen definition explicitly references the 'special' template, overriding the default
### web.xml

This web.xml deployment descriptor configures the Web Application Framework (WAF) component of Java Pet Store. It defines servlet mappings, listeners, and environment entries essential for the web tier functionality. Key configurations include the MainServlet as the web tier entry point, TemplateServlet for screen rendering, and component manager setup. The file establishes URL patterns (.do and .screen extensions), session timeout settings, and EJB references that connect the web tier to the business logic layer through the EJBController.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 50`: DefaultComponentManager listener registration enables application-wide component management
- `Line 60`: MainServlet configuration with default locale parameter establishes the central controller for handling web requests
- `Line 71`: TemplateServlet configuration with caching parameters controls the template-based view rendering system
- `Line 123`: Component Manager implementation class is defined as an environment entry for flexible implementation switching
- `Line 138`: EJB local reference establishes connection between web tier and EJB controller
