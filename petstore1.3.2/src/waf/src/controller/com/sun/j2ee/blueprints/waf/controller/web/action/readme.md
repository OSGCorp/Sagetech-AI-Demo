# Subproject WAF Web Actions Framework Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates J2EE best practices through a functional e-commerce application. The program showcases enterprise application architecture and implements cross-platform capabilities. This sub-project implements the Command pattern in the web controller layer along with foundational interfaces and classes for handling web requests. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Structured request handling through a consistent action interface
- Lifecycle management for web request processing
- Separation of concerns between action logic and web infrastructure
- Exception handling specific to the web action framework

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/web/action/actions

This sub-project implements concrete action handlers for processing web requests, serving as the controller layer between the frontend UI and the business logic. WAF Web Action Implementations provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request handling for both HTML and API/JSON responses
- Locale management and internationalization support
- Form processing and validation
- View composition through request chaining

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format**: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. **Complex Request Chaining**: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. **Automated Form Field Typing**: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. **View Chaining**: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling. The localization component exemplified by ChangeLocaleHTMLAction demonstrates how the framework handles user preferences while maintaining a clean separation between presentation logic and business functionality.

## Business Functions

### Web Controller Framework
- `HTMLAction.java` : Defines the HTMLAction interface for handling web requests in the WAF controller framework.
- `HTMLActionException.java` : Custom exception class for HTML action processing errors in the web controller framework.
- `HTMLActionSupport.java` : Abstract support class for HTML actions in the web controller framework.

## Files
### HTMLAction.java

HTMLAction interface defines the base contract for request handlers in the web tier of the Web Application Framework (WAF). It specifies four key methods that implementing classes must provide: setServletContext for context initialization, doStart for pre-processing requests, perform for executing the main action logic and returning an Event, and doEnd for post-processing after event handling. The interface extends Serializable, allowing implementing classes to be serialized if needed. This interface serves as the foundation for the command pattern implementation in the web controller framework.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: The interface extends Serializable, enabling implementing action classes to be persisted across HTTP sessions if needed.
- `Line 55`: The perform method returns an Event object, demonstrating the event-driven architecture of the WAF framework.
### HTMLActionException.java

HTMLActionException implements a serializable exception class used in the web application framework (WAF) controller component. This exception is specifically thrown when errors occur during flow handler processing in HTML actions. The class extends the standard Java Exception class and implements Serializable interface for proper exception handling across distributed systems. It provides two constructors: a default no-argument constructor and one that accepts a string message parameter to provide error details. This exception helps in managing error conditions within the action processing pipeline of the web controller framework.
### HTMLActionSupport.java

HTMLActionSupport implements an abstract base class that serves as the default implementation of the HTMLAction interface in the web application framework (WAF). It provides a foundation for handling HTML-based actions in the controller layer. The class defines core functionality including servlet context management and lifecycle methods for action processing. Key methods include setServletContext() to store the servlet context, and empty implementations of doStart() and doEnd() methods that subclasses can override to implement specific action behavior before and after event processing.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: This abstract class implements the HTMLAction interface but provides empty implementations of lifecycle methods, following the Template Method pattern
