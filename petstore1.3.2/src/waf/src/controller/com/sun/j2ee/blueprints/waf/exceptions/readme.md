# WAF Exception Handlers Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java EE application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices for e-commerce systems. The program implements a complete online pet store with browsing, shopping cart, and order processing capabilities. This sub-project implements exception handling mechanisms for the Web Application Framework (WAF) component along with standardized error reporting structures. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Runtime exception handling specific to web application contexts
- Serializable exception objects for proper error state preservation
- Nested exception support for maintaining complete error context
- Consistent error handling patterns across the WAF layer

## Identified Design Elements

1. Hierarchical Exception Structure: The framework establishes a clear inheritance hierarchy with GeneralFailureException serving as the base for web runtime errors
2. Error Context Preservation: Exception classes maintain both error messages and original exception objects to preserve complete error context
3. Serialization Support: Exceptions implement Serializable to ensure proper state preservation across application boundaries
4. Simplified Application Error Handling: AppException provides a streamlined mechanism for application-specific error conditions

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between general web framework failures and application-specific exceptions. GeneralFailureException provides robust error context preservation by capturing both messages and nested exceptions, while AppException offers a lightweight alternative for application-level errors. This design supports effective debugging and error reporting throughout the application while maintaining a clear distinction between different error types and sources.

## Business Functions

### Exception Handling
- `GeneralFailureException.java` : A base exception class for web runtime errors in the WAF framework.
- `AppException.java` : A simple exception class that extends RuntimeException for application-level error handling.

## Files
### AppException.java

AppException implements a basic exception class that extends RuntimeException for the Web Application Framework (WAF) component of the Java Pet Store application. This class provides a minimal implementation with just a single constructor that accepts a string message parameter and passes it to the parent RuntimeException class. The class serves as a foundation for application-specific exception handling within the WAF controller layer, allowing developers to throw runtime exceptions with custom error messages.
### GeneralFailureException.java

GeneralFailureException implements a base exception class for web runtime errors in the Java Pet Store's Web Application Framework (WAF). It extends RuntimeException and implements Serializable, providing a foundation for all web-related runtime exceptions. The class offers two constructors: one accepting only an error message string and another accepting both a message and a Throwable object. It also includes a getThrowable() method that returns a formatted message containing the nested exception's message. This class serves as a common error handling mechanism throughout the WAF component.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: The class implements Serializable to allow exception objects to be passed between JVM instances or persisted
