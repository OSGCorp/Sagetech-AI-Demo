# WAF Event Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java application that demonstrates J2EE enterprise application patterns and best practices. The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases component-based development using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements concrete event handling mechanisms along with internationalization support for the web application framework (WAF).  This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven architecture for handling user interactions
- Internationalization (i18n) support through locale management
- Integration with the EJBController for event processing
- JNDI-based event routing and identification

## Identified Design Elements

1. Event Propagation System: The EventSupport base class provides common functionality for all event types, allowing for consistent event handling throughout the application
2. Locale Management: Specialized events for handling user locale preferences that integrate with the application's internationalization framework
3. JNDI-Based Event Identification: Events are identified and routed using standardized JNDI naming conventions
4. Controller Integration: Events communicate directly with the EJBController to ensure proper handling of user interactions

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean event-driven design pattern where specific event types extend a common base class. The ChangeLocaleEvent implementation demonstrates how the system handles internationalization preferences by capturing locale changes and propagating them to the appropriate controller. This approach ensures separation of concerns between the UI layer and business logic while providing a flexible framework for handling various types of user interactions.

## Business Functions

### Internationalization
- `ChangeLocaleEvent.java` : Event class for notifying the EJBController about locale changes in the web application framework.

## Files
### ChangeLocaleEvent.java

ChangeLocaleEvent implements an event class that extends EventSupport to notify the EJBController when a user changes their locale preference. The class stores a Locale object and provides methods to retrieve it. It's part of the web application framework's event system for handling internationalization changes. Key functionality includes storing the locale information and providing access to it through getLocale(). The class also implements getEventName() which returns a JNDI name used to identify this event type in the event handling system. Important elements include the locale instance variable, the constructor that initializes it, and the two getter methods.
