# WAF Web Controller Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates J2EE enterprise application development best practices through an e-commerce implementation. The program showcases component-based architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements the web-tier controller components of the MVC architecture along with request processing and event handling mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Front controller pattern implementation for HTTP request processing
- URL-to-action mapping through configurable XML definitions
- Event handling and delegation between web and EJB tiers
- Session-scoped component management for controllers

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/web/util

This sub-project implements web controller utilities that provide the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses within the application's web tier. The WAF Web Controller Utilities provide these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Standardized request handling and response generation
- Consistent data access patterns across web components
- Scoped data management (request, session, application)
- Web flow control and navigation

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Standardized Key Management**: The `WebKeys` class defines constants used throughout the web tier to maintain consistency when storing and retrieving data across different scopes.
2. **Component Access Framework**: Provides standardized access to managers, controllers, and processors through well-defined keys.
3. **Screen Flow Management**: Supports tracking of current and previous screens to enable proper navigation and state management.
4. **Internationalization Support**: Includes keys for locale settings to support multilingual capabilities.

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between the web tier and business logic through consistent key naming and access patterns. By centralizing these constants, the framework ensures that components can reliably communicate and share data without tight coupling. The utilities provide a foundation for maintaining application state across requests while supporting features like internationalization and user preferences. This design promotes maintainability by establishing clear conventions for how web components interact with the broader application architecture.

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/web/flow

The WAF Web Flow Controller sub-project implements the navigation and page flow control mechanisms that power the web interface. This controller framework provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- URL-to-screen mapping through XML configuration
- Exception-based navigation handling
- Flexible request processing with flow handlers
- Serializable flow state management

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Navigation Flow**: The controller uses a contract-based approach through the FlowHandler interface to standardize how navigation flows are processed and managed
2. **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Screen flows are defined in XML configuration files, allowing for changes to navigation without code modifications
3. **Exception-Based Navigation**: The framework maps exceptions to specific screens, creating a robust error handling system integrated with the navigation flow
4. **Serializable State Management**: Flow data is maintained in serializable objects, enabling state persistence across requests

#### Overview
The architecture follows a controller-based MVC pattern where the ScreenFlowManager serves as the central navigation coordinator. Flow handlers implement the processing logic that determines which view should be displayed next, while the ScreenFlowData maintains the mappings between exceptions and destination screens. This design creates a clean separation between navigation logic and view rendering, making the application more maintainable and allowing for complex navigation patterns while centralizing flow control.

## Files
### ComponentManager.java

ComponentManager interface defines services that need to be accessed from multiple components in the web tier. It extends HttpSessionListener to ensure it's loaded at startup. The interface is designed for implementations that initialize objects used in the presentation tier. It declares a single method getWebController() that retrieves a WebController instance from an HttpSession, with the controller intended to be stateless and not tied to any specific user.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Interface extends HttpSessionListener specifically to ensure the implementing class is loaded at application startup
### DefaultComponentManager.java

DefaultComponentManager implements a component manager that provides access to web and EJB tier services in the Java Pet Store application. It manages the creation and retrieval of WebController and EJBControllerLocal instances tied to HTTP sessions. Key functionality includes initializing controllers, handling session lifecycle events, and providing a centralized access point for application components. Important methods include getWebController(), getEJBController(), sessionCreated(), and sessionDestroyed(). The class uses ServiceLocator to obtain configuration values and EJB homes, and implements HttpSessionListener to respond to session lifecycle events.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 75`: Uses Java Beans instantiation pattern to dynamically create controller instances based on configuration
- `Line 89`: Implements session-scoped caching of EJB controller references to improve performance
- `Line 114`: Silently suppresses exceptions during session destruction to prevent errors during application shutdown
### DefaultWebController.java

DefaultWebController implements a proxy class that bridges HTTP requests to the EJB tier in the WAF (Web Application Framework). It handles web events by delegating them to an EJBControllerLocal instance managed by a ComponentManager. The class provides initialization with an HttpSession, synchronized event handling to prevent concurrent requests to the stateful session bean, and proper resource cleanup through the destroy method. Key methods include init(HttpSession), handleEvent(Event, HttpSession), and destroy(HttpSession). The controller retrieves the EJBController from the session's ComponentManager to process events and manage the application's business logic.

 **Code Landmarks**

### EventMapping.java

EventMapping implements a simple mapping class that associates event class names with their corresponding EJB action class names in the Web Application Framework (WAF) controller. The class stores two string properties: eventClass and ejbActionClass. It provides a constructor to initialize these properties and getter methods to retrieve them. The class also implements java.io.Serializable to support object serialization and includes a toString() method for debugging purposes. This mapping is likely used by the controller to determine which EJB action to invoke when processing specific events.
### MainServlet.java

MainServlet implements a front controller servlet for the Web Application Framework (WAF). It processes HTTP requests, manages URL mappings, and controls screen flow. The servlet initializes by loading URL and event mappings from XML configuration, then processes requests through a RequestProcessor and forwards to appropriate views via ScreenFlowManager. Key functionality includes locale handling, exception management, and maintaining application context attributes. Important components include the doProcess method, getRequestProcessor, getScreenFlowManager, and getURLMapping methods, along with urlMappings and eventMappings HashMaps.

 **Code Landmarks**

- `Line 132`: Uses lazy initialization pattern for application components
### RequestProcessor.java

RequestProcessor implements a web tier controller responsible for processing HTTP requests from Main.jsp and generating events to modify data. It maps URLs to appropriate actions and events to EJB actions using configuration from ServletContext. Key functionality includes initializing URL and event mappings, processing requests by finding the appropriate HTMLAction class, executing the action, handling any resulting events through the WebController, and managing the request lifecycle. Important methods include processRequest(), getURLMapping(), getEventMapping(), and getAction(). The class uses URLMapping and EventMapping objects to determine which actions to execute for specific URLs and events.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 115`: Core request processing method that handles the complete request lifecycle from URL parsing to event handling
- `Line 94`: URL pattern matching system that maps incoming request URLs to appropriate action handlers
- `Line 106`: Event mapping system that associates event classes with corresponding EJB action classes
### URLMapping.java

URLMapping implements a class that maps URLs to specific actions and screens in the web application framework. It stores information about whether a URL represents an action, requires a flow handler, and maintains mappings between action results and target screens. The class provides methods to retrieve the associated web action class, flow handler, screen information, and result mappings. Key fields include url, isAction, useFlowHandler, webActionClass, flowHandler, resultMappings, and screen. Important methods include getWebAction(), getFlowHandler(), getScreen(), and getResultScreen(String).

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: Constructor overloading allows creating both simple screen mappings and complex action mappings
- `Line 84`: Result mapping lookup allows dynamic navigation based on action outcomes
### URLMappingsXmlDAO.java

URLMappingsXmlDAO provides functionality to parse and load URL mappings, event mappings, and exception mappings from XML configuration files for the web application framework. It uses DOM parsing to extract mapping information that defines the application's navigation flow, screen transitions, and exception handling. Key methods include loadDocument(), loadScreenFlowData(), loadRequestMappings(), loadEventMappings(), and loadExceptionMappings(). The class defines numerous constants for XML element and attribute names, and implements helper methods for XML node traversal and value extraction. The parsed data is used by the ScreenFlowManager to control application navigation flow.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 116`: Uses DOM parsing to extract configuration data from XML files that define the application's navigation flow
- `Line 179`: Creates a HashMap of exception mappings that link exception class names to screen identifiers for error handling
- `Line 198`: Builds event mappings that connect event class names to EJB action classes
- `Line 209`: Complex method that parses URL mappings with support for flow handlers and result mappings
### WebController.java

WebController interface defines the contract for web controllers in the Web Application Framework (WAF). It serves as a proxy between HTTP requests and the EJB tier, handling events from the web tier and translating them to business logic operations. The interface declares three essential methods: init() for initializing the controller with an HTTP session, handleEvent() for processing events and returning appropriate responses, and destroy() for cleaning up resources. The controller ensures thread safety by synchronizing access to the EJB tier, preventing concurrent requests to stateful session beans.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 59`: The interface extends java.io.Serializable, suggesting controllers need to be serializable for session storage
- `Line 51`: Comment indicates this is a proxy pattern implementation to the EJB tier with synchronized methods for thread safety
- `Line 75`: handleEvent method serves as the core event processing mechanism, connecting web events to business logic
