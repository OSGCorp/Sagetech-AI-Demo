# WAF EJB Controller Of Java Pet Store

The WAF EJB Controller is a Java subproject that implements the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) tier controller components within the Java Pet Store's Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The subproject serves as the intermediary layer between the web tier and the business logic, handling event processing and state management. This controller framework enables dynamic connection of EJB components at runtime, facilitating reusable component support throughout the application. The WAF EJB Controller provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven processing through a state machine architecture
- Dynamic runtime connection of EJB components
- Session state management via attribute maps
- Standardized event handling with consistent response formatting

## Identified Design Elements

1. State Machine Architecture: Implements a robust state machine that processes events and maintains application state through an attribute map
2. Dynamic Component Resolution: Looks up appropriate EJB action implementations based on event names at runtime
3. Session Management: Maintains client session state across multiple requests through the EJB container
4. Standardized Event Processing: Provides a consistent interface for handling events and generating responses

## Overview
The architecture follows standard EJB design patterns with clear separation between interfaces (EJBControllerLocal, EJBControllerLocalHome) and implementation classes (EJBControllerLocalEJB, StateMachine). The controller layer acts as the orchestrator for business logic, receiving events from the web tier and delegating processing to appropriate action handlers. The state machine maintains session context and provides attribute storage, enabling complex workflows across multiple requests. This design promotes maintainability through separation of concerns and leverages the EJB container for transaction management, security, and lifecycle handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/ejb/action

The program showcases enterprise application architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements the Command pattern within the EJB controller layer, providing a structured approach to event handling and state management. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Standardized event processing lifecycle
- State machine integration for application flow control
- Serializable action components for EJB compatibility
- Structured exception handling for event processing errors

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format.
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request.

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Business Functions

### Controller Components
- `EJBControllerLocalEJB.java` : EJB controller implementation for handling events in the Web Application Framework.
- `EJBControllerLocal.java` : Defines the local EJB interface for the controller component in the Web Application Framework.
- `EJBControllerLocalHome.java` : Local home interface for EJB controller component in the Web Application Framework.

### State Management
- `StateMachine.java` : A state machine that processes events from the client tier by mapping them to appropriate EJB actions.

## Files
### EJBControllerLocal.java

EJBControllerLocal interface defines the local EJB interface for the controller component in the MVC architecture of the Web Application Framework. It extends EJBLocalObject and serves as the EJB-tier controller that manages client session activities. The interface declares a single method, processEvent(), which accepts an Event object and returns an EventResponse, potentially throwing an EventException. This method is responsible for feeding events to the business logic state machine and processing them accordingly.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 53`: Interface extends EJBLocalObject to function as a local EJB component within the J2EE architecture
### EJBControllerLocalEJB.java

EJBControllerLocalEJB implements a session bean that serves as part of the controller layer in the Web Application Framework (WAF). It processes application events through a StateMachine, which handles the event flow logic. The class implements the SessionBean interface with standard EJB lifecycle methods (ejbCreate, ejbRemove, ejbActivate, ejbPassivate). The key functionality is the processEvent method that delegates to the StateMachine to handle events and return appropriate responses. The class maintains references to the StateMachine and SessionContext objects.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 56`: The StateMachine is initialized during ejbCreate(), establishing the event processing infrastructure for the controller.
- `Line 62`: The processEvent method serves as the primary entry point for event handling, delegating to the StateMachine component.
### EJBControllerLocalHome.java

EJBControllerLocalHome interface defines the local home interface for the EJB controller component in the Web Application Framework (WAF). This interface extends EJBLocalHome and provides a single create method that returns an EJBControllerLocal object. The create method throws a CreateException if the controller cannot be created. This interface is part of the controller layer in the WAF architecture, enabling local access to the controller EJB within the same JVM.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: Defines a local EJB interface rather than a remote one, indicating this controller is meant for same-JVM access, optimizing performance by avoiding remote call overhead.
### StateMachine.java

StateMachine implements a component responsible for processing events received from the client tier in the WAF framework. It dynamically connects EJB components at runtime, enabling reusable component support. The class maintains state in an attributeMap and handles events by looking up appropriate EJBAction implementations based on event names. Key functionality includes processing events through the appropriate action handlers, managing attributes, and providing access to the EJB controller. Important methods include processEvent(), setAttribute(), getAttribute(), getEJBController(), and getSessionContext().

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 78`: The class uses a HashMap to cache action instances for better performance rather than instantiating them on each request
- `Line 86`: Dynamic class loading and instantiation pattern allows for extensibility without modifying the state machine code
- `Line 91`: The action lifecycle includes doStart(), perform(), and doEnd() phases, creating a well-defined execution flow
