# WAF EJB Actions Framework Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates J2EE best practices through a functional e-commerce application. The program showcases enterprise application architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements the Command pattern within the EJB controller layer, providing a structured approach to event handling and state management. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Standardized event processing lifecycle
- State machine integration for application flow control
- Serializable action components for EJB compatibility
- Structured exception handling for event processing errors

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format.
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request.

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/ejb/action/actions

The subproject implements event-driven controllers that bridge the web application framework with the underlying EJB business tier. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Internationalization support through locale management
- Integration between the web presentation layer and EJB business logic
- Event-driven action handling for web requests
- State management within the MVC architecture

#### Identified Design Elements

1. **EJB Action Support Framework**: The subproject extends a base EJBActionSupport class to create specific action handlers that process different types of application events
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Actions are triggered by specific event types, such as the ChangeLocaleEvent, allowing for loose coupling between UI events and business logic
3. **State Machine Integration**: Actions interact with a state machine to maintain application state across requests, storing attributes like locale preferences
4. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between the controller layer (actions) and the model/view components of the application

#### Overview
The architecture follows a command pattern approach where each action class handles a specific type of business operation. The EJB actions serve as controllers that receive events from the presentation layer, process them using the appropriate business logic, and update the application state. This design promotes maintainability through separation of concerns, allowing the presentation layer to remain decoupled from the business logic implementation details. The framework supports internationalization through dedicated locale management actions, enabling a consistent multilingual user experience throughout the application.

## Business Functions

### Action Framework
- `EJBActionSupport.java` : Abstract base class for EJB actions in the WAF controller framework.
- `EJBAction.java` : Defines the EJBAction interface for handling events in the WAF controller framework.

## Files
### EJBAction.java

EJBAction interface defines the contract for action classes that handle events within the Web Application Framework (WAF) controller. It provides a lifecycle for event processing with initialization, start, perform, and end methods. The interface requires implementations to interact with a StateMachine for state management and to process Event objects, returning appropriate EventResponse objects. The perform method can throw EventException when errors occur during event processing. This interface is a core component of the controller's event handling mechanism in the J2EE Blueprints architecture.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: The interface defines a clear lifecycle for actions with init, doStart, perform, and doEnd methods
### EJBActionSupport.java

EJBActionSupport implements an abstract base class for EJB actions in the Web Application Framework (WAF) controller. It provides a foundation for action classes that interact with the StateMachine component. The class implements both the java.io.Serializable interface and the EJBAction interface. Key functionality includes initialization with a StateMachine reference and empty lifecycle methods (doStart and doEnd) that subclasses can override to implement specific behavior when actions begin and complete. The protected StateMachine field allows subclasses to access state transition functionality.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: Implementation of both Serializable and EJBAction interfaces suggests these actions need to be persisted and follow a specific contract
