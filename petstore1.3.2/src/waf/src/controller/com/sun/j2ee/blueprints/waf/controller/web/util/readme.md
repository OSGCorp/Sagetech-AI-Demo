# WAF Web Controller Utilities Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation demonstrating best practices for building enterprise applications using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements web controller utilities that provide the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses within the application's web tier. The WAF Web Controller Utilities provide these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Standardized request handling and response generation
- Consistent data access patterns across web components
- Scoped data management (request, session, application)
- Web flow control and navigation

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Standardized Key Management**: The `WebKeys` class defines constants used throughout the web tier to maintain consistency when storing and retrieving data across different scopes.
2. **Component Access Framework**: Provides standardized access to managers, controllers, and processors through well-defined keys.
3. **Screen Flow Management**: Supports tracking of current and previous screens to enable proper navigation and state management.
4. **Internationalization Support**: Includes keys for locale settings to support multilingual capabilities.

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between the web tier and business logic through consistent key naming and access patterns. By centralizing these constants, the framework ensures that components can reliably communicate and share data without tight coupling. The utilities provide a foundation for maintaining application state across requests while supporting features like internationalization and user preferences. This design promotes maintainability by establishing clear conventions for how web components interact with the broader application architecture.

## Business Functions

### Web Constants
- `WebKeys.java` : Defines constant string keys used for data storage across web-tier components in the WAF framework.

## Files
### WebKeys.java

WebKeys defines a collection of public static final String constants that serve as standardized keys for storing and retrieving data across different scopes of the web-tier in the WAF framework. These keys are used to access components like managers, controllers, screen information, URL data, and user preferences in various application contexts. The class prevents instantiation through a protected constructor. The constants defined include references to component managers, screen flow managers, request processors, current/previous screens, URL mappings, locale settings, and controller references.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 45`: Protected constructor prevents instantiation, ensuring the class functions purely as a constants container
- `Line 47-67`: Constants follow a consistent naming convention with fully-qualified package prefixes to avoid namespace collisions
