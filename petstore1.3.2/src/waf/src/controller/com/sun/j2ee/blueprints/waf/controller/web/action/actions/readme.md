# WAF Web Action Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference application that demonstrates enterprise application architecture and best practices using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements concrete action handlers for processing web requests, serving as the controller layer between the frontend UI and the business logic. WAF Web Action Implementations provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request handling for both HTML and API/JSON responses
- Locale management and internationalization support
- Form processing and validation
- View composition through request chaining

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format**: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. **Complex Request Chaining**: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. **Automated Form Field Typing**: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. **View Chaining**: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling. The localization component exemplified by ChangeLocaleHTMLAction demonstrates how the framework handles user preferences while maintaining a clean separation between presentation logic and business functionality.

## Business Functions

### Localization Management
- `ChangeLocaleHTMLAction.java` : Handles locale changes in the web application by processing user language selection requests.

## Files
### ChangeLocaleHTMLAction.java

ChangeLocaleHTMLAction implements an action class that processes user requests to change the application's locale/language. It extends HTMLActionSupport and implements the perform method which extracts the locale parameter from HTTP requests, converts it to a Locale object using I18nUtil, stores it in the user's session, and returns a ChangeLocaleEvent. If the locale conversion fails, it throws an HTMLActionException. The class is part of the WAF (Web Application Framework) controller component that manages locale-related user interactions in the Java Pet Store application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 71`: Uses I18nUtil utility class to convert string representation of locale to a Locale object
- `Line 75`: Stores locale in session with a constant key for application-wide access
- `Line 76`: Returns a ChangeLocaleEvent that propagates the locale change throughout the application
