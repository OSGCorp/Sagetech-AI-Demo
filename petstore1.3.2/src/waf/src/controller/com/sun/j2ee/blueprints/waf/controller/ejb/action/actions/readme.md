# WAF EJB Action Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The WAF EJB Action Implementations is a Java subproject that provides concrete action implementations for Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) business logic within the Java Pet Store application. The subproject implements event-driven controllers that bridge the web application framework with the underlying EJB business tier. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Internationalization support through locale management
- Integration between the web presentation layer and EJB business logic
- Event-driven action handling for web requests
- State management within the MVC architecture

## Identified Design Elements

1. **EJB Action Support Framework**: The subproject extends a base EJBActionSupport class to create specific action handlers that process different types of application events
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Actions are triggered by specific event types, such as the ChangeLocaleEvent, allowing for loose coupling between UI events and business logic
3. **State Machine Integration**: Actions interact with a state machine to maintain application state across requests, storing attributes like locale preferences
4. **MVC Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between the controller layer (actions) and the model/view components of the application

## Overview
The architecture follows a command pattern approach where each action class handles a specific type of business operation. The EJB actions serve as controllers that receive events from the presentation layer, process them using the appropriate business logic, and update the application state. This design promotes maintainability through separation of concerns, allowing the presentation layer to remain decoupled from the business logic implementation details. The framework supports internationalization through dedicated locale management actions, enabling a consistent multilingual user experience throughout the application.

## Business Functions

### Internationalization
- `ChangeLocaleEJBAction.java` : Handles locale change events in the Java Pet Store application's web application framework.

## Files
### ChangeLocaleEJBAction.java

ChangeLocaleEJBAction implements an action handler for locale changes in the web application framework. It extends EJBActionSupport and overrides the perform method to process ChangeLocaleEvent objects. When a locale change event is received, the action extracts the new locale from the event and stores it as an attribute named 'locale' in the state machine. The class is part of the controller layer in the MVC architecture of the web application framework, enabling internationalization support throughout the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 47`: The action doesn't return an EventResponse (returns null), indicating this action doesn't require any specific response handling.
