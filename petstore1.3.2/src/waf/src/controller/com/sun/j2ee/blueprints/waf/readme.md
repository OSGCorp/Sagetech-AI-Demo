# WAF Controller Components Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation that demonstrates J2EE best practices through an e-commerce application. The WAF (Web Application Framework) Controller Components sub-project implements the core MVC controller architecture that processes HTTP requests and coordinates the application's response flow. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request routing and dispatching to appropriate handlers
- View resolution and rendering for different output formats
- Form processing and validation
- Session management and state preservation
- Integration with the business logic layer

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/util

The program implements enterprise patterns and showcases cross-platform capabilities. This sub-project implements internationalization support and JNDI integration along with controller utility functions. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Internationalization and localization services
- Consistent JNDI naming conventions
- Currency and number formatting with locale-specific patterns
- Service discovery through standardized JNDI lookups

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/exceptions

The program implements a complete online pet store with browsing, shopping cart, and order processing capabilities. This sub-project implements exception handling mechanisms for the Web Application Framework (WAF) component along with standardized error reporting structures. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Runtime exception handling specific to web application contexts
- Serializable exception objects for proper error state preservation
- Nested exception support for maintaining complete error context
- Consistent error handling patterns across the WAF layer

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Hierarchical Exception Structure: The framework establishes a clear inheritance hierarchy with GeneralFailureException serving as the base for web runtime errors
2. Error Context Preservation: Exception classes maintain both error messages and original exception objects to preserve complete error context
3. Serialization Support: Exceptions implement Serializable to ensure proper state preservation across application boundaries
4. Simplified Application Error Handling: AppException provides a streamlined mechanism for application-specific error conditions

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes clean separation between general web framework failures and application-specific exceptions. GeneralFailureException provides robust error context preservation by capturing both messages and nested exceptions, while AppException offers a lightweight alternative for application-level errors. This design supports effective debugging and error reporting throughout the application while maintaining a clear distinction between different error types and sources.

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller

The WAF Controller Core sub-project implements the central MVC architecture controller layer that bridges the web presentation tier with the EJB business logic tier. This controller framework provides the foundation for request handling, view resolution, and data flow management throughout the application.

The WAF Controller Core delivers these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Unified request processing for both synchronous web pages and asynchronous API calls
- Standardized view resolution with template-based rendering
- Centralized error handling and exception management
- Flexible data binding between HTTP requests and Java objects
- Session management and security context propagation

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/event

The program implements component-based architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE best practices. This sub-project implements an event-driven communication framework along with serializable event handling mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven communication between application components
- Standardized event handling across application tiers
- Serializable event objects for cross-tier communication
- Support for EJB command pattern integration

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Event Interface Hierarchy: A well-structured interface hierarchy with Event as the base contract and EventSupport as the foundation implementation
2. Command Pattern Integration: Events can be associated with specific EJB action classes that process them through the command pattern
3. Serializable Events: All events implement Serializable to enable seamless transfer between application tiers
4. Payload-Based Response Model: EventResponseSupport provides a standardized way to include payload data in event responses

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes a clean separation between event definitions and their handlers, enabling loose coupling between components. The event system serves as the communication backbone for the application, allowing different modules to interact without direct dependencies. By implementing the command pattern through EJB action classes, the system provides a flexible mechanism for processing events across the application's distributed architecture. The exception handling is centralized through the EventException class, providing consistent error management throughout the event processing lifecycle.
