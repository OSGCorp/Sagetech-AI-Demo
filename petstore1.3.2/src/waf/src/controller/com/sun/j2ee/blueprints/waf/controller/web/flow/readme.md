# WAF Web Flow Controller Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation that demonstrates J2EE best practices through a functional e-commerce application. The WAF Web Flow Controller sub-project implements the navigation and page flow control mechanisms that power the web interface. This controller framework provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- URL-to-screen mapping through XML configuration
- Exception-based navigation handling
- Flexible request processing with flow handlers
- Serializable flow state management

## Identified Design Elements

1. **Structured Navigation Flow**: The controller uses a contract-based approach through the FlowHandler interface to standardize how navigation flows are processed and managed
2. **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Screen flows are defined in XML configuration files, allowing for changes to navigation without code modifications
3. **Exception-Based Navigation**: The framework maps exceptions to specific screens, creating a robust error handling system integrated with the navigation flow
4. **Serializable State Management**: Flow data is maintained in serializable objects, enabling state persistence across requests

## Overview
The architecture follows a controller-based MVC pattern where the ScreenFlowManager serves as the central navigation coordinator. Flow handlers implement the processing logic that determines which view should be displayed next, while the ScreenFlowData maintains the mappings between exceptions and destination screens. This design creates a clean separation between navigation logic and view rendering, making the application more maintainable and allowing for complex navigation patterns while centralizing flow control.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/web/flow/handlers

The program implements MVC architecture and provides a reference implementation of best practices for J2EE development. This sub-project implements flow handling mechanisms for managing request processing and state management along with client-side state persistence capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request flow management through the web application
- Client-side state persistence and retrieval
- Parameter decoding and deserialization
- Seamless state restoration between HTTP requests

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Client-Side State Management: Implements Base64 encoding/decoding to persist application state in the client browser between requests
2. Parameter Processing: Extracts and deserializes encoded parameters from HTTP requests to restore application state
3. Flow Control: Manages the request processing lifecycle through doStart(), processFlow(), and doEnd() methods
4. Integration with Tag Libraries: Works in conjunction with ClientCacheLinkTag to embed state information in web pages

#### Overview
The architecture emphasizes stateless server design by offloading state persistence to the client side, enhancing scalability. The flow handler implementation provides a clean separation between state management and business logic, allowing for more maintainable code. By using standard Java serialization and Base64 encoding, the system ensures compatibility across different environments while maintaining security through proper deserialization practices. This approach enables complex multi-step workflows while minimizing server-side session storage requirements.

## Business Functions

### Flow Control
- `FlowHandler.java` : Defines the FlowHandler interface for managing web application flow control in the WAF framework.
- `FlowHandlerException.java` : Custom exception class for flow handler processing errors in the web application framework.
- `ScreenFlowData.java` : Defines data structure for managing screen flow and exception handling in the web controller.
- `ScreenFlowManager.java` : Manages web application screen flow and URL mappings for navigation control

## Files
### FlowHandler.java

FlowHandler interface defines the core contract for flow handlers in the web tier of the Web Application Framework (WAF). It extends Serializable and provides three essential methods: doStart() for initialization, processFlow() for handling request processing and determining the next view, and doEnd() for cleanup operations. These methods enable structured navigation flow control within web applications, with processFlow() potentially throwing FlowHandlerException when errors occur during flow processing.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 51`: The interface extends Serializable, allowing flow handlers to be persisted across HTTP sessions
### FlowHandlerException.java

FlowHandlerException implements a simple exception class used within the web application framework's flow control system. This serializable exception extends the standard Java Exception class to represent errors that occur during flow handler processing. The class provides two constructors: a default no-argument constructor and one that accepts a string message to be passed to the parent Exception class. This specialized exception helps identify and handle flow-related errors within the controller component of the web application framework.
### ScreenFlowData.java

ScreenFlowData implements a serializable class that stores information needed for managing screen flow in the web controller framework. It maintains a mapping between exceptions and their corresponding screen destinations, along with a default screen to display. The class provides methods to access the default screen and exception mappings. Key components include the exceptionMappings HashMap that stores exception-to-screen relationships, the defaultScreen String for fallback navigation, and accessor methods getDefaultScreen() and getExceptionMappings() to retrieve these values.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: Implements Serializable to support state persistence across HTTP requests in the web application flow
### ScreenFlowManager.java

ScreenFlowManager implements navigation control for a web application by mapping URLs to screens and flow handlers. It loads URL mappings from XML configuration files, determines which screen to display based on request URLs, and handles navigation flow. The class supports both direct screen mappings and dynamic flow handling through FlowHandler implementations. It also provides exception handling by mapping exception types to appropriate error screens. Key methods include forwardToNextScreen(), getURLMapping(), getExceptionScreen(), and getCurrentScreen(). Important variables include urlMappings, exceptionMappings, and defaultScreen.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 94`: Uses XML configuration files to define URL mappings and screen flow, enabling declarative navigation control
- `Line 126`: Dynamic class loading of FlowHandler implementations allows for extensible navigation logic
- `Line 167`: Uses Java reflection (isAssignableFrom) to match exception hierarchies for error handling
