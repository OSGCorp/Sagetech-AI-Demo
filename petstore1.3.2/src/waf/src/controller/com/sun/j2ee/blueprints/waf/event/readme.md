# WAF Event System Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java program that demonstrates J2EE enterprise application patterns through an e-commerce platform. The program implements component-based architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE best practices. This sub-project implements an event-driven communication framework along with serializable event handling mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven communication between application components
- Standardized event handling across application tiers
- Serializable event objects for cross-tier communication
- Support for EJB command pattern integration

## Identified Design Elements

1. Event Interface Hierarchy: A well-structured interface hierarchy with Event as the base contract and EventSupport as the foundation implementation
2. Command Pattern Integration: Events can be associated with specific EJB action classes that process them through the command pattern
3. Serializable Events: All events implement Serializable to enable seamless transfer between application tiers
4. Payload-Based Response Model: EventResponseSupport provides a standardized way to include payload data in event responses

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes a clean separation between event definitions and their handlers, enabling loose coupling between components. The event system serves as the communication backbone for the application, allowing different modules to interact without direct dependencies. By implementing the command pattern through EJB action classes, the system provides a flexible mechanism for processing events across the application's distributed architecture. The exception handling is centralized through the EventException class, providing consistent error management throughout the event processing lifecycle.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/event/impl

The program implements a complete e-commerce solution and showcases component-based development using J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements concrete event handling mechanisms along with internationalization support for the web application framework (WAF).  This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven architecture for handling user interactions
- Internationalization (i18n) support through locale management
- Integration with the EJBController for event processing
- JNDI-based event routing and identification

#### Identified Design Elements

1. Event Propagation System: The EventSupport base class provides common functionality for all event types, allowing for consistent event handling throughout the application
2. Locale Management: Specialized events for handling user locale preferences that integrate with the application's internationalization framework
3. JNDI-Based Event Identification: Events are identified and routed using standardized JNDI naming conventions
4. Controller Integration: Events communicate directly with the EJBController to ensure proper handling of user interactions

#### Overview
The architecture follows a clean event-driven design pattern where specific event types extend a common base class. The ChangeLocaleEvent implementation demonstrates how the system handles internationalization preferences by capturing locale changes and propagating them to the appropriate controller. This approach ensures separation of concerns between the UI layer and business logic while providing a flexible framework for handling various types of user interactions.

## Business Functions

### Event Handling System
- `EventException.java` : A base exception class for event-related errors in the WAF controller framework.
- `EventSupport.java` : Base class for all application events in the WAF framework with EJB action class support.
- `EventResponse.java` : Defines the EventResponse interface for WAF event handling in the Java Pet Store application.
- `EventResponseSupport.java` : Abstract support class for event responses in the WAF controller framework.
- `Event.java` : Defines the Event interface for the Web Application Framework (WAF) event system.

## Files
### Event.java

Event interface defines the contract for events in the Web Application Framework (WAF) event system. It extends Serializable to enable events to be passed between system tiers. The interface requires implementing classes to provide methods for setting and retrieving an EJB action class name that processes the event in the EJB tier, as well as a method to get the event name. This interface serves as the foundation for the event-driven communication mechanism in the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 43`: The interface extends Serializable, enabling events to be transmitted across JVM boundaries or persisted
### EventException.java

EventException implements a base exception class for all event-related exceptions in the Web Application Framework (WAF) controller. This simple class extends Java's standard Exception class and implements the Serializable interface to support serialization. It provides two constructors: a default no-argument constructor and one that accepts a String message parameter which is passed to the parent Exception class. The class serves as a foundation for more specific event exceptions within the application's event handling system.
### EventResponse.java

EventResponse interface establishes the contract for event responses within the Web Application Framework (WAF) of Java Pet Store. It extends Serializable to enable event responses to be serialized across the application. The interface defines a single method, getEventName(), which returns a logical name that maps to events in the StateMachine. This mapping facilitates event handling and processing within the application's state management system. The interface serves as a foundation for implementing various event response types in the application's event-driven architecture.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 42`: The interface extends Serializable, enabling event responses to be transmitted across JVM boundaries or persisted
### EventResponseSupport.java

EventResponseSupport implements a convenience abstract class for event responses in the Web Application Framework (WAF). It provides a basic implementation of the EventResponse interface with payload management functionality. The class maintains a private payload object that can be set through the constructor and retrieved via the getPayload() method. This simple implementation serves as a foundation for concrete event response classes to extend, providing a standard way to handle response data in the event-driven architecture of the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 46`: The class uses a generic Object type for payload, allowing flexibility in the types of data that can be passed through event responses
### EventSupport.java

EventSupport implements the base class for all events used in the application, serving as the foundation for the event system in the Web Application Framework (WAF). It implements the Event interface and provides functionality to associate events with EJB action classes (commands) that will process them. The class maintains an ejbActionClassName field that specifies which EJB command should handle the event, with null indicating no EJB command processing is needed. Key methods include getEJBActionClassName(), setEJBActionClassName(), and getEventName(), which returns null by default and is meant to be overridden by subclasses.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: The class implements Serializable (via Event interface) specifically to support RMI-IIOP communication with EJB containers
- `Line 54`: The ejbActionClassName field enables a command pattern implementation where events are associated with their handlers
