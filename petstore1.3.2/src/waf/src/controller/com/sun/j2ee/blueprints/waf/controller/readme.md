# WAF Controller Core Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation demonstrating J2EE best practices through an e-commerce application. The WAF Controller Core sub-project implements the central MVC architecture controller layer that bridges the web presentation tier with the EJB business logic tier. This controller framework provides the foundation for request handling, view resolution, and data flow management throughout the application.

The WAF Controller Core delivers these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Unified request processing for both synchronous web pages and asynchronous API calls
- Standardized view resolution with template-based rendering
- Centralized error handling and exception management
- Flexible data binding between HTTP requests and Java objects
- Session management and security context propagation

## Identified Design Elements

1. Manages Responses In Both JSON and HTML Format: The base controller class implements an API to allow the requestor to receive the results of the request in either format
2. Complex Request Chaining: More complex requests can be composed of simple atomic elements defined in the widgets folder
3. Automated Form Field Typing: Through introspection of the target data class, the form input controllers are able to validate input types match the intended data format
4. View Chaining: Sub-views do not need to re-query parent data objects, as they are encoded and passed into the chained request

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes DRY principles through partial reuse, maintains consistent styling via Bootstrap integration, and provides comprehensive format support for both traditional web and API consumers. The templates are designed for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

## Sub-Projects

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/web

The program showcases component-based architecture and provides a reference implementation for J2EE technologies. This sub-project implements the web-tier controller components of the MVC architecture along with request processing and event handling mechanisms. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Front controller pattern implementation for HTTP request processing
- URL-to-action mapping through configurable XML definitions
- Event handling and delegation between web and EJB tiers
- Session-scoped component management for controllers

### src/waf/src/controller/com/sun/j2ee/blueprints/waf/controller/ejb

The subproject serves as the intermediary layer between the web tier and the business logic, handling event processing and state management. This controller framework enables dynamic connection of EJB components at runtime, facilitating reusable component support throughout the application. The WAF EJB Controller provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Event-driven processing through a state machine architecture
- Dynamic runtime connection of EJB components
- Session state management via attribute maps
- Standardized event handling with consistent response formatting

#### Identified Design Elements

1. State Machine Architecture: Implements a robust state machine that processes events and maintains application state through an attribute map
2. Dynamic Component Resolution: Looks up appropriate EJB action implementations based on event names at runtime
3. Session Management: Maintains client session state across multiple requests through the EJB container
4. Standardized Event Processing: Provides a consistent interface for handling events and generating responses

#### Overview
The architecture follows standard EJB design patterns with clear separation between interfaces (EJBControllerLocal, EJBControllerLocalHome) and implementation classes (EJBControllerLocalEJB, StateMachine). The controller layer acts as the orchestrator for business logic, receiving events from the web tier and delegating processing to appropriate action handlers. The state machine maintains session context and provides attribute storage, enabling complex workflows across multiple requests. This design promotes maintainability through separation of concerns and leverages the EJB container for transaction management, security, and lifecycle handling.
