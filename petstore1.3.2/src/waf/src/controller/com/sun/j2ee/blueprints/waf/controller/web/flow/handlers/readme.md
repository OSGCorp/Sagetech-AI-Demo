# WAF Flow Handler Implementations Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based application that demonstrates J2EE enterprise patterns for e-commerce functionality. The program implements MVC architecture and provides a reference implementation of best practices for J2EE development. This sub-project implements flow handling mechanisms for managing request processing and state management along with client-side state persistence capabilities. This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Request flow management through the web application
- Client-side state persistence and retrieval
- Parameter decoding and deserialization
- Seamless state restoration between HTTP requests

## Identified Design Elements

1. Client-Side State Management: Implements Base64 encoding/decoding to persist application state in the client browser between requests
2. Parameter Processing: Extracts and deserializes encoded parameters from HTTP requests to restore application state
3. Flow Control: Manages the request processing lifecycle through doStart(), processFlow(), and doEnd() methods
4. Integration with Tag Libraries: Works in conjunction with ClientCacheLinkTag to embed state information in web pages

## Overview
The architecture emphasizes stateless server design by offloading state persistence to the client side, enhancing scalability. The flow handler implementation provides a clean separation between state management and business logic, allowing for more maintainable code. By using standard Java serialization and Base64 encoding, the system ensures compatibility across different environments while maintaining security through proper deserialization practices. This approach enables complex multi-step workflows while minimizing server-side session storage requirements.

## Business Functions

### State Management
- `ClientStateFlowHandler.java` : Handles client-side state management by decoding Base64-encoded parameters from web pages.

## Files
### ClientStateFlowHandler.java

ClientStateFlowHandler implements FlowHandler to manage client-side state persistence in web applications. It primarily decodes and deserializes Base64-encoded parameters that were previously embedded in web pages using ClientCacheLinkTag. The class processes HTTP requests by extracting encoded attributes, deserializing them, and restoring them as request attributes. Key methods include doStart(), processFlow(), and doEnd(), with processFlow() containing the core functionality for parameter extraction and deserialization. The class uses Apache Commons Base64 for decoding and standard Java serialization for object reconstruction.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 65`: Uses Apache Commons Base64 decoder to handle encoded state parameters
- `Line 71`: Implements object deserialization from Base64-encoded strings to restore client state
- `Line 74`: Dynamically reconstructs request attribute names by stripping prefix patterns
