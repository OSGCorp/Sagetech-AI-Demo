# Base64 Encoding Library Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a Java-based reference implementation demonstrating J2EE enterprise application development patterns. This sub-project implements a specialized Base64 encoding and decoding library that facilitates secure data transmission between components of the Pet Store application. The library provides essential encoding capabilities for transmitting binary data through text-based protocols within the application's architecture.

This provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Binary-to-text encoding for safe data transmission across networks
- Efficient conversion between binary data and ASCII character strings
- Support for encoding sensitive information in web communications
- Compatibility with standard Base64 implementations for interoperability

## Identified Design Elements

1. Streamlined Encoding/Decoding API: Simple interface methods for converting between binary data and Base64 encoded strings
2. Performance Optimization: Efficient implementation to handle large data volumes with minimal overhead
3. Standards Compliance: Adherence to RFC 2045 (MIME) Base64 encoding specifications
4. Error Handling: Robust validation and exception management for malformed input

## Overview
The architecture follows a clean, focused design that prioritizes reliability and performance. The library is governed by the Apache Software License 1.1, ensuring proper attribution requirements while allowing integration within the larger Pet Store application. The implementation is deliberately lightweight to minimize dependencies and maximize portability across different components of the application.
