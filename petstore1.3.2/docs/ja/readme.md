# Docs - Japanese Language Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a reference implementation demonstrating J2EE best practices for building enterprise applications. This sub-project provides comprehensive Japanese language documentation for the application, enabling Japanese-speaking developers to effectively deploy, configure, and extend the system. The documentation covers the entire application lifecycle from installation through configuration and usage, with localized technical explanations of the architecture and implementation details.

This sub-project provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Complete Japanese localization of all technical documentation
- Configuration guides for Japanese-specific deployment scenarios
- Step-by-step installation instructions for Japanese environments
- Detailed usage guides with Japanese UI references and workflows

## Identified Design Elements

1. Comprehensive Documentation Structure: Organized into installation, configuration, usage, and build documentation sections that mirror the English documentation
2. Legal Compliance: Includes properly localized copyright notices and legal disclaimers for the Japanese market
3. Technical Adaptation: Contains database configuration instructions specific to Japanese character encoding requirements
4. Localization Extension Guide: Provides instructions for adding support for additional languages beyond the default implementations

## Overview
The documentation architecture follows a logical progression from installation through configuration to usage, ensuring Japanese developers can successfully deploy and extend the application. The materials maintain consistency with the English documentation while addressing Japan-specific technical considerations such as character encoding and localization requirements. The documentation serves both as a user guide and as a technical reference for developers working with the Java Pet Store in Japanese environments.

## Files
### README.html

This is a minimal Japanese README HTML file for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2. It contains only a title identifying the application as part of Java BluePrints for the Enterprise and a brief instruction directing users to refer to index.html for more information. The file uses EUC-JP character encoding for Japanese text display.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 3`: Uses EUC-JP character encoding specification for Japanese text display
### building.html

This HTML document provides Japanese instructions for building the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 application. It explains how to use Ant 1.4.1 as the build tool for compiling all application binaries including the main Pet Store, Order Processing Center, Supplier, and Admin applications. The page details required configuration properties in build.properties file, provides command syntax for both Windows and UNIX environments, and lists available Ant targets such as core, clean, deploy, undeploy, verify, and docs. It also includes instructions for building individual application components and mentions Forte for Java IDE support.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 52`: Explains that the Pet Store application uses JMS for communication between Order Processing Center and Supplier components
- `Line 59`: Details critical build.properties configuration parameters needed for successful compilation
- `Line 139`: Shows the file paths where compiled EAR files are generated for each application component
### configuring.html

This HTML file provides Japanese-language configuration documentation for Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2. It covers three main configuration areas: email notification setup (both using J2EE SDK tools and manual configuration), adding localization support for additional languages, and configuring alternative databases. The document includes step-by-step instructions with code examples for modifying configuration files like ejb-jar.xml, sun-j2ee-ri.xml, and web.xml. It explains how to enable email notifications for order approval, confirmation, and completion, as well as how to customize mail server settings. For localization, it describes adding JSP pages for new languages and modifying XML files. Database configuration instructions detail how to adapt SQL statements for different database systems.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 31`: Document outlines three major configuration areas with anchor links for navigation
- `Line 207`: Shows XML configuration for email notification settings with boolean toggles
- `Line 318`: Demonstrates database abstraction through XML configuration files with database-specific SQL statements
- `Line 374`: Shows how to configure database selection through web.xml and EJB deployment descriptors
### copyright.html

This HTML file contains the Japanese language copyright notice for Java BluePrints materials. It states that all materials are Sun Microsystems' intellectual property, prohibits unauthorized reproduction, and includes standard copyright information. The document includes the copyright year range (1995-2003), Sun's address, trademark notices, and disclaimers regarding warranties and potential changes to materials.
### index.html

This HTML file serves as the Japanese language landing page for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 documentation. It provides an introduction to the demo application developed by Sun Microsystems as part of the Java BluePrints program. The page includes navigation links to installation instructions, usage guide, building instructions, and configuration documentation. It also describes the purpose of the Java BluePrints for Enterprise program and references additional resources including a book that covers the Java Pet Store Demo in detail.
### installing.html

This HTML document provides installation instructions for Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 in Japanese. It outlines system requirements including J2SE SDK v1.4.1 and J2EE SDK v1.3.1, explains necessary environment variables (JAVA_HOME, J2EE_HOME, PATH), and provides step-by-step installation instructions. The guide includes specific command sequences for both UNIX and Windows platforms to extract the application, build and install database resources, start the Cloudscape database, launch the J2EE server, and deploy the application.
### using.html

This HTML document is a Japanese language user guide for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 application. It explains how to use the four main components: Storefront (web interface for customers to browse and order pets), OPC (Order Processing Center), Supplier (inventory management), and Admin (order approval interface). The guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating user accounts, placing orders, approving/denying orders, and managing inventory. It includes navigation links, screenshots, and explanations of the workflow between different components of the application.

 **Code Landmarks**
