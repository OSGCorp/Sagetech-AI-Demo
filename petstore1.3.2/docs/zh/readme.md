# Docs - Chinese Language Subproject Of Java Pet Store

The Java Pet Store is a J2EE reference implementation that demonstrates enterprise application development best practices through a simulated e-commerce platform. The Docs - Chinese Language subproject provides comprehensive Simplified Chinese localization for all user-facing documentation, enabling Chinese-speaking developers to effectively deploy, configure, and extend the application. This documentation suite covers the entire application lifecycle from installation through operation and customization.

This subproject provides these capabilities to the Java Pet Store program:

- Complete Chinese language documentation for installation and configuration
- Localized user guides for all three application components (Storefront, Admin, Supplier)
- Build instructions for compiling from source in a Chinese language environment
- Legally compliant copyright and licensing information in Simplified Chinese

## Identified Design Elements

1. Comprehensive Application Coverage: Documentation spans the entire application lifecycle including installation, configuration, usage, and build processes
2. Component-Specific Documentation: Separate guides for the three main application components (Storefront, Admin, Supplier)
3. Technical Configuration Support: Detailed instructions for database connectivity, email notifications, and localization settings
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Instructions differentiated for both Windows and Unix environments

## Overview
The architecture of this documentation subproject follows a logical progression from installation through configuration and usage, with specialized sections for developers needing to build from source. The documentation maintains consistent terminology and formatting throughout, with clear navigation between related topics. The Chinese localization is implemented using gb2312 character encoding to ensure proper display of Simplified Chinese characters across different platforms and browsers.

## Files
### README.html

This is a simple Chinese language README HTML file for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2. It contains minimal content with a title indicating it's part of Java BluePrints for the Enterprise and instructs users to refer to index.html for guidance. The file uses gb2312 character encoding for Chinese text display.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 4`: Uses gb2312 character encoding specifically for Chinese character support
### building.html

This HTML file provides Chinese language instructions for building the Java Pet Store Demo application. It explains how to use Ant 1.3.1 to compile the source code, configure the build environment by editing build.properties, and execute build scripts on both Windows and Unix systems. The document details important configuration parameters like j2ee.server.name, j2ee.server.port, and j2ee.home, and describes build targets including core, clean, deploy, undeploy, verify, and docs. It also provides instructions for building individual application components: petstore (storefront), opc (order processing), supplier, and admin.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 48`: Mentions that the Pet Store Demo uses JMS to implement communication between order processing and suppliers
- `Line 56`: Details critical build.properties configuration parameters needed before building the application
- `Line 146`: Explains how to build individual application components from their respective directories
### configuring.html

This HTML document provides configuration instructions for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 in Chinese. It covers three main areas: setting up email notifications (both through J2EE SDK tools and by manually editing deployment descriptors), configuring localized versions of the application (currently supporting English, Japanese, and Chinese), and customizing database connections to use alternatives to the default Cloudscape database. The document includes step-by-step instructions with code examples for modifying XML configuration files and deployment descriptors to enable these customizations.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 32`: Document provides instructions for configuring email notifications through both GUI tools and manual XML editing
- `Line 191`: Explains localization support for multiple languages (English, Japanese, Chinese) with file path conventions
- `Line 219`: Details database abstraction through XML configuration files that allow switching between database vendors
### copyright.html

This HTML file contains the Chinese (Simplified) version of the copyright notice for Java BluePrints technology. It declares that all rights to Java BluePrints are owned by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The document includes statements about Sun's intellectual property rights, trademark information, and disclaimers about the software being provided 'as is' without warranties. It also notes that information is subject to change without notice.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 5`: Uses gb2312 character encoding specifically for Simplified Chinese text rendering
### index.html

This HTML file serves as the Chinese language index page for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2 documentation. It provides an introduction to the demo application developed by Sun Microsystems' Java BluePrints program. The page includes navigation links to installation instructions, usage guide, building instructions, and configuration documentation. It also contains information about the Java BluePrints for Enterprise program and references to related resources including books and websites. The page is formatted with a simple table-based layout and includes the Sun Microsystems copyright notice.

 **Code Landmarks**
- `Line 6`: Uses gb2312 character encoding specifically for Chinese language support
- `Line 25`: Contains localized Chinese text explaining the purpose of the Java Pet Store Demo application
- `Line 32`: Provides a structured navigation menu to other documentation pages in Chinese
### installing.html

This HTML document provides Chinese-language installation instructions for the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2. It outlines system requirements (J2SE SDK v1.4.1 and J2EE SDK v1.3.1), environment variable setup (JAVA_HOME and J2EE_HOME), and a step-by-step installation process. The document guides users through extracting the application archive, running setup scripts for database and resources, starting Cloudscape database and J2EE server, and deploying the application, with separate instructions for Unix and Windows systems.
### using.html

This HTML document provides Chinese language instructions for using the Java Pet Store Demo 1.3.2. It explains the application's three main components: Storefront (web interface for customers to browse products and place orders), Admin (Swing-based client for administrators to approve/deny orders), and Supplier (web interface for inventory management). The guide includes step-by-step instructions for creating user accounts, placing orders, approving/denying orders, and managing inventory. It also explains how these components interact through the Order Processing Center (OPC) system.
